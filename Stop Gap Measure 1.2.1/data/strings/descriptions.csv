# Ships,,,,,
,,,,,
filgap_asp,SHIP,"This custom-built bomber use only low-tech part. Unlike most others bomber design, the Asp bolst a good speed to compensate the short range of its David missile it carries. Not able to make any difference in large battle, but cheap and good in pursuit and against small ships.",,,
filgap_ethon,SHIP,"This midline interceptor is a failed design brought back to life by the desperate times of the Sector. It sports a single Locust Salvo and a boosted PD Laser designed to engage small craft. The hull itself has good capabilities, but lacks firepower and is unable to shot down enemy ordinance.",,,

filgap_salvagecorvette,SHIP,"A common ship-based civilian corvette used for slavage, orbital construction and repair. A turret was added post-Collapse to support its parent carrier.",,,



filgap_velite,SHIP,"
The Velite relies solely on ballistic and energy mounts, with sufficient power supply to keep a steady rate of fire. Unlike other mid-tech ships of its size, the Velite fits in no particular defensive or offensive role. While the ship sports no fancy systems or higher-than-average specificities like speed or armor, it is easily mass-produced and is able to field various weapon loadouts for increased adaptability.

When the Persean League was formed, the unification of the many various defense fleets was expected to be difficult. Indeed, industrial capabilities, weaponry and manpower varied greatly from one world to another. As Hegemony, and later Tri-Tachyon dreams of expansion were approaching, the Persean League was looking for a way to field a uniform fleet composition across its territory. The Hoplite is one of the results of the resultant development program.",,,
filgap_huntsman,SHIP,"The Huntsman is an old design dating from the early era of the sector. At the time, it was designed with a support role in mind. Bearing several composite mounts, the Huntsman could be assigned many different roles like missile boat, gunship or escort. However, weak armor and poor generator performance means that the ship is not well suited to front-line duties. Instead, it uses a series of auxiliary jets to flee from overpowering foes and redeploy during battle.",,,

filgap_merx,SHIP,"Since Tri-Tachyon has some of the most valuable and rare assets in the sector, the Corporation cannot afford losing them in small skirmishes and looked for an alternative. The Merx is a small conversion of the Mercury acting as a cheap rank-and-file corvette. It mount a supplementary slot for missile weaponery occupying most of the passenger space. Easily produced, its crew is expected to make sure to protect irrepleceable ships, going as far as to sacrifice itself in the process...",,,

filgap_fulk,SHIP,"Faced with the need to increasing its defensive capabilities, the Luddic Church decided to introduce a new frigate type designed for convoy defense and patrol duties. The Hound was selected for its high armor and maneuverability. However, the Fulk no longer looks much like its parent, as its hull has been significantly enlarged. Crewed by new aspirants, the Fulk provides protection to others ships thanks to lateral flare launchers and several point deference mounts. The ship is not able to beat enemy frigates in a one-on-one scenario, and is expected to sacrifice itself in order to protect the more valuable assets of the Luddic Church fleet.

In the heart of Luddic Church dogma lies the rejection of relying on machines to do human deeds. In effect, most advanced ships designs are simply rejected for production and banished from Church territory. This policy comes with at a price however, as the Knights are expected to fight technological abominations with old ships often unable to match their foes. Following border conflicts with Tibicena station, the Knights of Ludd decreed that new ships must be developed to drive back any threat from the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. These must however comply with the Luddic Church precepts, meaning that any new designs have to revolve around already known approved ships models and low levels of automation.",,,
filgap_dove,SHIP,"The Dove is a lightly armed scout ship used as a scout and sentinel for larger fleets.

Following a successful infiltration into the root software of the Comm relay system by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, the Hegemony government ordered the destruction of all existing relays until a replacement network was built. Factions had to rely on couriers and messengers to carry out orders and news. The Dove was one of the ship classes designed to fill this role. When the FTL relay net was rebuilt, the Dove was decommissioned and later converted to fit a scouting role. With limited ordnance, the Dove relies on speed to flee from enemy threats. The ship now integrates a sensor package and is used as a scout for hegemony detachments.",,,
filgap_chondrite,SHIP,"The Chondrite is a light freighter once built to conduct fast interplanetary transport of perishable but valuable goods. Once praised for its sub-luminal delivery speed, it is now praised for how quickly it can get out of trouble once it inevitably finds itself in a combat environment.",,,
filgap_traverse,SHIP,"Before the Cerberus and the Hound were considered freighters of choice in the dangerous space of the Sector, the Traverse was a more common design which gained its  popularity thanks to its higher cargo capacity than ships of similar size.",,,
filgap_pyrphoros,SHIP,"The Pyrphoros is a desperate attempt to convert the most common tanker in the sector - the Dram into a combat vessel. The hull has received structural reinforcement and now also boasts several gun mounts as well as missile racks. The ship is still poorly armored, feels under-gunned and moves like a brick. This converted design is only fielded by pirates when no other ship is available. ",,,
,,,,,
filgap_dragoon,SHIP,"The Dragoon is a destroyer with a strange layout based on the Cossack. Its designed in a much more agressive way, including frontal weapons and an experimental EMP system.

This destroyer was probably designed as an offset of the Cossack, or both ships are jsut very radical version of the same structure. Both ships were envision as escort destroyer, and the Dragoon was expected to follow larger combat unit and protect it against the emergence of small attack craft and missiles swarm. Production ability of this ship has now been long lost and the ship is only seen as derelict in remote ruined system or in scavenger fleet lucky enough to salvage it in proper conditions.",,,
filgap_cossack,SHIP,"This ship is an escort carrier designed at the same time as the Legion. Designed as a polyvalent platform, the cossack is able to lead patrol and provide efficient support to the rest of the fleet.

By the time it was designed, the Cossack was only a minor success, trying to accomplish to many tasks and being master of none. It cannot fill front line duty nor act as a true dedicated carrier. However, it is appreciated by today Hegemony fleet thinkers because of its simple production and its ability to be a temporary solution to lacking role in any fleet.

Some pattern in the flux system of the ship, its divided structure and peculiar fitting of the missile systems argue that the Cossack is part of a larger design able fill many roles. The ship structures seems to be a platform on which other module can be installed to radically change the loadout.",,,
,,,,,

filgap_templar,SHIP,"Based on the widespread and well known design of the Enforcer, the Templar is built to serve as a missile destroyer in fleet engagements. It is expected to unload its two medium missile mounts at the right time during battle, while still providing support with its ballistic mount. This design replaces two ballistic medium mounts by smaller ones and sacrifices the burn drive to mount a faster reloading system for missile mounts. 

In the heart of Luddic Church dogma lies the rejection of relying on machines to do human deeds. In effect, most advanced ships designs are simply rejected for production and banished from Church territory. This policy comes with at a price however, as the Knights are expected to fight technological abominations with old ships often unable to match their foes.

These must however comply with the Luddic Church precepts, meaning that any new designs have to revolve around already known approved ships models and low levels of automation.",,,
filgap_apex,SHIP,"The Apex is a retro-fit of the Apogee. The cruiser has been re-purposed into a front-line ship or to serve in a command role by independent factions unable to produce true dedicated warships. Its exploration systems and its large storage have been removed and replaced by large bays. The main weaponry is based on salvaged TPC's which can make use of the efficient flux systems. Since Apogee cruisers are valuable exploration vessels, only the most desperate or minor independent planets are willing to convert those venerable hulls. Most often, the Apexs are re-built derelicts or ships whose owners were unable to maintain properly.",,,

filgap_bogomil,SHIP,"The Bogomil is a fire support destroyer based on the Tarsus freighter. Most of the space in the freighter was used to implement an ammo feeder system provisioning the heavy ballistic mount. The ship enjoys the hull strength of the Tarsus, but also its poor flux capacity, even with the improvements to the original generator. This destroyer is thus best used along other ships in a fleet battle. The Luddic Church chose to produce this ship as the Tarsus parts are easily produced by the low-tech facilities on Ceyx, which doesn't impair Condor conversion.

These must however comply with the Luddic Church precepts, meaning that any new designs have to revolve around already known approved ships models and low levels of automation.",,,
filgap_pyrrhocorax,SHIP,"This light carrier is a support ship, both in combat and logistically. With few weapons and only one wing complement, it cannot lead the fight in the front-line. However, adaptable load-outs and a large fuel and cargo storage capacity makes it a valuable addition to any small raiding party.

A proper design of Tri-Tachyon, the Pyrrhotorax was birthed following the first IA war when attack fleets had to rely on Gemini and other low combat-value ships for logistical support. Using spare parts and easily produced components, the ship was designed to provide support to high-tech frigates, including protection against enemy carriers, electronic warfare and long-range firepower.",,,
filgap_herder,SHIP,"When the Drover-class carrier was put in production, many officers complained about the outward appearance of the ship and nicknamed it the 'brick'. As a consequence, Orion Shipyards designed a new ship with identical parts and characteristics as the Drover. The Herder fills the exact same role as the Drover, its just prettier than its predecessor. The replacement program was still active when the gates shut down, meaning both classes are commonly encountered within the sector.
Take it with a pinch of salt.",,,
filgap_copernic,SHIP,"
The Copernic is a specialized science vessel sporting two adaptable modules to give it some flexibility in its duties. It's primary benefits are an upgraded space hazard shielding to protect its delicate sensor equipment and the necessary modular space to fit two more logistics modifications as per the requirements of its mission. It is commonly employed in exploration, but can also serve as a specialized electronic warfare ship for factions able to maintain this kind of technology. While capable of defending itself, the Copernic lacks the punch to be able to fit in combat in more than a support role.",,,
filgap_ballista,SHIP,"The Ballista is a destroyer focusing heavily on missile weaponry. While not able to defend itself properly, it can support combat lines by unleashing volleys of missiles adapted to every situation. 

This ship is undoubiously of pirate origin. A close look quickly allows to recognize part of civilian ships which cannot be repurposed in better designs. Large internal space is occupied by stocks of ordnance to supply its large missile payload. The design is commonly shunned by factions with proper ship building capacities due to its heavy supply burden and it often sees use in defense fleets where missile inventories can be easily replenished.",,,
filgap_tantive,SHIP,"The Tantive combat freighter started its live as a atmospheric combat gunship for special forces and other elite troops. However, idea occurs to Tri-Tachyon to reconvert old manoeuvring jets to new plasma ones. The Tantive is now used as a blockade runner, with a forward facing armament and shield designed to pearce the enemy lines then flee using its increase thrusting capabilitys",,,
filgap_orthus,SHIP,"The Orthus is an early high-tech ship designed at the same time as the Odyssey to act as a ship-of-the-line in frontal assaults. The ship boasts a strong shield backed up by a fortress system. Sporting several forward-facing energy mounts and a complement of missile systems, the Orthus is able to anchor any line of battle.

This destroyer was rapidly phased out by more maneuverable designs and the appearance of phase skimmer technology. It is a rather uncommon ship at odds with most of the factions warfare philosophy, but can still be found in Tri-Tachyon patrol fleets.",,,

filgap_wardlaw,SHIP,"
This combat-oriented conversion of the Tarsus freighter into a destroyer, or more precisely a Q-Ship, is used to give some protection to merchant fleets against lesser threats. This ship is designed as well as a poor-man's destroyer can be, yet it is capable of can springing a nasty surprise on unsuspecting pirates and privateers alike. The Wardlaw keeps the original shape of a Tarsus and can easily be mistaken for one on long range sensors, but when engaged in combat up close, it reveals itself to be the predator rather than the prey. Or at the very least more dangerous prey.

Many turrets have been added to the general frame, as well as a better field generator so that this combat freighter can hold its own against true raider frigates. Heavy armor plating has also been added to improve protection, but also to conceal the other modifications. Finally, improved thrusters allow it to still reach decent speed. However, much of the original cargo space has been filled with combat equipment, so the Wardlaw is no longer able anymore to ferry large cargo loads.",,,

filgap_nitassinan,SHIP,"The Nistassinan was born shortly after the collapse by converting a system-bound tug and utility ship  into a combat destroyer. A robust ship used by independant shipyard, it bolst an interesting mix of firepower and heavy armor. No fancy system nor powerfull drive mean it’s mostly deployed when no true military grade destroyer are available. This design is vulnerable to flanking.",,,



filgap_chrysops,SHIP,"At the apex of the firepower doctrine sponsored by the Domain, a RnD project was tasked to developed a new hull integrating recent discovery in phase field area. The destroyer relies on sneaking and frontal firepower over armor. With plating comparable to a frigate one, the Chrysops uses instead a damper field to protect it when not using its phase cloak. 

The project was deemed too costly and never saw large scale production. It can still be found as blueprint in remote stations, but is not currently in use in the Sector.",,,


,,,,,
filgap_opportunity,SHIP,"Originally developed by a Khazeron deserter and later Pirate Warlord, the Opportunity is a mash-up of civilian ship components added to the base platform of the Venture to transform it into a true warship. The original ships' trade cargo space and mining drone bays were replaced with heavy plating, reinforced bulkheads and a better power generator. Additionally, a Damper field was also installed, as well as supplemental weapon mounts.

The Opportunity includes components from common trade ships which haven't already been re-purposed by pirate fleets. While simple in its design and easily reproducible, the conversion job still needs proper facilities meaning only the richer pirate warlords can own a Opportunity-class Cruiser.",,,
filgap_adjudicator,SHIP,"The Adjudicator class armored Cruiser fills the role of convoy leader or fleet escort. Its weapon mounts have broad firing arcs to counter more maneuverable ships. A centralized armory in the heart of the ship allows it to unleash impressive firepower at the right moment. However, its generator is not able to sustain advanced weaponry nor to withstand heavy fire. Thus the ship is aimed at hunting enemy destroyers and is not expected to enter full-scale battle against larger enemy vessels.

During the AI wars, the Hegemony’s resources were stretched to their limits. The Industrial power of the Aztlan and Corvus systems was unable to produce sufficient ship hulls to keep up with attrition rates. Moreover, frequents raids on mercantile convoys by Try-Tachyon forces threatened to bring hull production to a standstill. Hegemony R&D proposed to solve both problems -intensive raiding and a lacks of ships- by commissioning a new cruiser to escort heavy cruisers and convoys against fast enemy ships. In cooperation with the naval scrapyard of Nomios, they designed a ship based on easy to produce and salvageable parts of ships of the line. The resulting Adjudicator is an elegant mash-up of Onslaught, Falcon and Dominator ship parts. In quieter periods, the ship was decommissioned en mass and sold to neutral worlds. The hull is still produced as a part of a trade pact with the Luddic Church due to its contribution during the IA wars..",,,
filgap_foundation,SHIP,"While most Mora-class carriers have been put in service again, some of the converted designs can still be seen within the Sector. The Foundation is one of them, serving as a mobile dry dock used in salvage operations. Its reduced carrier capabilities allow it to serve as a support vessel, complemented by its original missile complement.",,,
filgap_wagner,SHIP,"This cruiser sized vessel dates from the early epoch of energy weaponry. Its primary role is to anchor the battle line, providing frontal firepower while exposing only a small silhouette. The Wagner comprises a wide array of different weaponry, making it a great ship for inventive captains wanting to try different loadouts. It is still considered outclassed in regard to others line cruisers commonly used in the sector and is vulnerable to flanking fire.",,,
filgap_cathar,SHIP,"The Cathar is a more sensible attempt at converting the Colossus into a true cruiser. The huge cargo hold now shelters a more efficient generator, while the hull is upgraded with more armor as well as a bristling array of weapons. The ship performs well in frontal assaults and is also designed to cover other ships of the Luddic fleet. The conversion work of a ship this size is however only possible in large shipyards. This means that the Luddic Church produces Cathar hulls at a slow rate and deploys them only when necessary.",,,
filgap_starblazer,SHIP,"This makeshift carrier uses the hull of the Starliner to provide fleet-wide protection to any civilian convoy. Its large bays allow a respectable complement of wings but its makeshift decks struggle to quickly replace losses during long engagements. The ship has some active defenses of its own thanks to numerous small mounts and the original shield mounted on the Starliner. However, its armor is paper-thin and the Starblazer remains easy prey when caught without its fighter complement. 

This conversion is a rare occurrence in the sector. The process to convert the Starliner is long and fastidious, but doesn't need a huge amount of resources. Non-aligned worlds, scavengers, pirates and other groups without access to production facilities or military-grade carriers are the most likely to use the Starblazer.",,,
filgap_contemptor,SHIP,"The Contemptor is a strange design in regard to its age. It bolsters an integrated TPC and heavy armor like the Onslaught, mounting substantial forward firepower typical of early period of the Domain. However, the ship seems to be a conversion of something older. Life support systems, cramped crew compartments and the shield generator appear to have been installed around others components where space was left. Moreover, the ship shows a strong level of automation, reducing the need for crew. Some scavengers say that aggressive, brainless ships similar to the Contemptor are hunting remote places never visited by human beings.",,,

filgap_redoubt,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A rare sight defending Domain probes, this ship is built around a TPC. The Redoubt is not to be underestimated, as it boasts significant frontal firepower and heavy armor.",,,

filgap_era,SHIP,"A highly customisable ship designed for frontier duty, the Era is a cruiser-sized ship originally assigned to orbital construction sites and mining fleets. It provides limited production capabilities and respectable cargo and fuel capacities. As the ship was supposed to remain mostly in real space and not expected to make long journeys in hyperspace, its burn speed is limited.

In the current age of the Sector, the Era is used as combat freighter, reserve cruiser and exploration vessel. Its combat capabilities are limited, but its integrated factory is able to extend the duration in which it can provide missile support.",,,

filgap_era_lc,SHIP,"Another custom conversion produced by the Church of Galactic Redemption, this version of the Era is providing a small complement of fighters to Luddic fleet, at the cost of customization and missile capacity.

The ship was initially the product of an unlikely cooperation between the sects of the Path and of Beholder station. The two factions shared production capacity and knowledge (respectively) to assemble "reclamation" fleets aiming at finding new marvel of the Creation, but also tracking and hunting down any soulless abomination left behind by the Domain. 

In the current age of the Sector, the Era is used as combat freighter, reserve cruiser and exploration vessel. Its combat capabilities are limited, but its integrated factory is able to extend the duration in which it can provide missile support.",,,


filgap_trajan,SHIP,"The design philosophy behind the Trajan-class Battlecarrier is quite simply: if you can't kill it with big guns, try with big ordinance. With the big guns usually supplied by the Conquest, this Battlecarrier fills other roles from combined assault to ranged support to fleet coverage. Fielding a full extent of missile systems, as well as a fast reloading mechanism, the Trajan can open the way for its fighter/bomber complement by sending wave after wave of missiles. Several energy and ballistic mounts allow it to directly engage multiple targets, as long as they aren't other capital ships. A rarer design than the Conquest, the Trajan is mostly fielded by the Persean League, as this kind of ship is shunned by the Hegemony and Tri-Tachyon prefers the Astral fleet carrier.",,,

filgap_charon,SHIP,"This small capital ship was deployed en-mass by the Domain to put down any independant will from frontier world. The external armor plating is designed for atmospheric entry and the hull can house a small invading force on its own. Once on the ground the ... will act as a forward supply and firepower base. Its powerfull engines allow escape from gravity well.

This ship is now a rare sight, as the armor plates are hard to maintain and produce, and the hull is to big to be build by most shipyards. Still, the ship is appreciated by aggressive factions for hostile take-over, or for colonization attempt, as it can still pack a punch against patrol and pirate fleets.",,,

# Weapons,,,,,
,,,,,
filgap_magaccelerator,WEAPON,The Mag Accelerator is the ancestor of the modern Railgun. This early tentative to create precise and reliable weapons is still used in fleet in many factions. The gun propels shells with a shaped charge which was adapted to battle before shields appear as a common characteristic for warship. Now the Mag Accelerator lacks punch for contemporaneous conflicts with a too heavy power requirement. It is mostly found on patrol ships or during anti-pirate actions.,Close Support,,
filgap_scattergun,WEAPON,The Scatter Gun is a mid-range PDS. The gun is notoriously inaccurate but fire a salvo of 6 slugs which perform well against missiles salvo. The system is not able to track lateral threat efficiently and is best used on frontal mount.,PDS,,
filgap_plasma_caster,WEAPON,"During the IA Wars, Tri-Tachyon raid parties were in needs of a weapon able to put constant pressure upon enemy while striking elements were manoeuvring. Scientists and engineers created a reduced-scale plasma canon to fire over-heated projectiles over larger distance than classical laser-weaponry. However, due to heat problems in the small weapon, it shoots 3 small projectiles in salvo with unusual inaccuracy for an energy weapon.",Assault,,
filgap_david,WEAPON,"A basic warhead with a shaped charge built by factions in need of anti-armor missiles and unable to get proper military-grade weaponry. The projectile has better speed and tracking ability than Harpoon thanks to smaller weight of the warhead, but is inefficient against anything bigger than a destroyer.",Strike,,
filgap_davidsystem,WEAPON,"
An improved launcher design to fire a short volley of anti-ship SRM. Easy to replicate, this launcher is commonly used by pirates and independent worlds unable to get their hands on Reaper torpedoes or Harpoon pods.

A basic warhead with a shaped charge built by factions in need of anti-armor missiles and unable to get proper military-grade weaponry. The projectile has better speed and tracking ability than Harpoon thanks to smaller weight of the warhead, but is inefficient against anything bigger than a destroyer.",Strike,,

filgap_ion_torpedo,WEAPON,"The Lotop is a pre-Collapse a long-range multi-purpose cruise missile deployed in large engagement upon target of opportunity. The MIRV system split in 6 warheads containing a plasma charge generating a ionizing effect. Considering its size and cost to deploy, launchers carry a smaller amount of reload in regard to more classical anti-capital missile launchers.",Strike,,
filgap_chargedlaser,WEAPON,"The charged laser is considered an older version, or a precursor of the pulse laser. It accumulates energy through a series of capacitor which is released and focus along a twin array as short bursts. The aging design allow a longer range but generate a massive amount of flux, relegating the weapon to auxiliary ships and pirates able to salvage it from old weapons caches.",Assault,,
filgap_icebomb,WEAPON,"An old weapon from another age, the energy bomb launcher was designed at the apex of shield technology. The ball of energy released produces a massive wave able to interfere with shield of ships in a large area. However, it generate massive amount of flux and take a long time to reload, making this weapon available only to the largest ships and space station. Since the collapse, the Ice Bomb has been lost and is now just a mere legend from a long past age. However, some veteran spacers claim that in some dark places of the sector, terrible inhuman things have been seen using such weapons with dreaded effect",Support,,
filgap_ion_torpedo_single,WEAPON,"A launcher sporting a single Lopot cruise missile. Mostly assigned to support frigate and as opportunity weapon for larger ships.

The Lotop is a pre-Collapse a long-range multi-purpose cruise missile deployed in large engagement upon target of opportunity. The MIRV system split in 6 warheads containing a plasma charge generating a ionizing effect. Considering its size and cost to deploy, launchers carry a smaller amount of reload in regard to more classical anti-capital missile launchers.",Strike,,

filgap_matsar,WEAPON,"The Matsar is the zenith of the Lotop technology. A fully fledged combat system including a firecontrol able to track to missile at a time, it also include a somewhat slow but reliable combat-rated reloader, ensuring combat performance for a long time.

The Lotop is a pre-Collapse a long-range multi-purpose cruise missile deployed in large engagement upon target of opportunity. The MIRV system split in 6 warheads containing a plasma charge generating a ionizing effect. Considering its size and cost to deploy, launchers carry a smaller amount of reload in regard to more classical anti-capital missile launchers.",Strike,,

filgap_psurge,WEAPON,"A byproduct of the plasma cannon, the plasma surge is an antic PDS system designed to stop wave of missiles. It projects a ball of plasma which turns unstable when encountering matter, provoking rapid expansion of super-heated energy. The unstable nature of the projectile means it’s somewhat short-ranged and struggles to pierce armor.  The weapon has a slow rate of fire due to heating problems, but its area of effect make it a useful PDS to cover the ship from missiles swarms.",PDS,,
filgap_miningbeam,WEAPON,"A simple mid-range mining-grade burst beam. Quite efficient but flux-hungry. The huge mass of the weapon makes it unwieldy, but it's still appreciated when no other energy weapon is available.",Support,,
filgap_miningarray,WEAPON,"Following the collapse, mining guilds have been a prime provider of makeshift weapons, repurposed ships and last-chance odd jobs. The MB-3 array is such an example, an acceptable tentative to build a heavier PDS for civilian ships. Three mining projectors are mounted together, firing overloaded streams. It allows better range and damage output than classical mining beam. However, the array is power-hungry and the more diffuse beam prevents it to be used against anything armoured or shielded.",PDS,,
filgap_hive,WEAPON,"A larger mount of the ubiquitous Swarm launcher. It includes an automated reloadig system but fire smaller salvo at a lower firing rate than its smaller cousin.",PDS,,
filgap_saturation_launcher,WEAPON,"A poor-man semi-guided missile only used by the desperate and planets unable to manufacture shaped charges. The launcher fire an impressive salvo, useful to finish crippled ships and divert fire from PDS. Useless against fighters.",Close Support,,
filgap_mosychlosbag,WEAPON,"This medium ballistic system is a crude mash-up of two smaller assault guns. The barrels have been extended to significantly increase the range. The ammos used are underwhelming for the size of the gun, and quickly loses accuracy at longer range. Vibration caused by recoil means the gun fire by salvo instead of a continuous way. The designed is still quite able to put down smaller ship and even threaten swarm of fighters.",Assault,,
filgap_aton,WEAPON,"The larger cousin of the charged laser is able to produce au constant stream for a short amount of time thanks to multiple heavy-duty capacitors. Great for general purpose but with lower range than the heaviest beam available.",General,,
filgap_scorpius,WEAPON,"A large launcher for the Pilum missile. The original explosive warhead is removed and replaced by a hyper-dense material tip and improved thruster. The resulting system allow to fire a volley a missile at long range efficient against shield. The ease of production of the missile allow to still fire during the all duration of the fight",Support,,

nora_station1,CUSTOM,"Initially designed to extract water to supply nearby Nepheria, this station has since been salvaged of any useful component.",,"The station has lain dormant for tens of cycles. Most systems, including life support, have been transferred to Nepheria, leaving the station a cold skeleton floating in space.",
planet_nepheria,CUSTOM,"This second-rank industrial planet would have been annexed long ago by the major factions without such a fiercely independent-minded population. The planet is well-defended, and each of the major factions are ready to assist it if any other makes a gesture to invade. Due to its particular position, Nepheria act as a diplomatic and trading no man's land.",,,
planet_scilly,CUSTOM,"Scilly is a giant ball of ice that would have been long forgotten if it weren't host to bacterial colonies beneath its icy crust. It was bought by Tri-Tachyon following the bankruptcy of a mining company several cycles ago. During the change of ownership, several troubles exploded on the planet, mostly between religious locals and the newly arrived Tri-Tachyon mercenaries, traders and staff. Most farmers fled to Nirut and Barra, and Scilly merely serves as a trade center between several factions, scavengers, and other parties.",,,
planet_lepia,CUSTOM,"Lepia was in the final steps of terraforming when the gates closed. While habitable, the atmosphere was still unfit to breath. Colonists already there were forced to adapt. Out of necessity, they turned Lepia into a remote place of entertainment for privateers, adventurers, unscrupulous peoples, and other scum. In exchange, the den benefits from security and supplies brought in by these marginal clients.",,,
planet_bythinia,CUSTOM,"Originally a dump for space junk, Bythinia was recently fitted with a scavenging outpost to salvage what was possible from the ruined hulks in order to supply the rest of the Corvus sector. Ludd is believed to have stayed here for a time, and since its beatification, the planet has attracted many pilgrims, which eventually led the Knights of Ludd to overtake Bythinia to ensure protection of the sacred world and its visitors.",,,
barra_station1,CUSTOM,"Designed as a space dock to help the terraformation of the Ivree system, Barra station was flooded by refugees fleeing pogroms on Prato. The Luddic Church soon annexed the station to protect refugees while keeping an eye on Prato and the maiden world of Nirut. Most refugees live in cramped conditions, toiling endlessly to construct new ships for the Church.",,,
planet_tenas,CUSTOM,"After the collapse, Tenas was home to a small colonization attempt to exploit small but easily accessible ore lodes to feed Nepheria's industry. Following the coming of regional powers and interstellar trading, conditions of working on Tenas quickly deteriorated, leading to large strikes across the world. The Hegemony and Persean League used this opportunity to attempt seizure of the Utic system, and in the end, Tenas was annexed by the league on the pretext of bringing order and security to its people."
ChibogStation1,CUSTOM,"Chibog station is a large zero-G industrial platform used initially to refine ores from Tenas during the isolation of the Utic system. Following a revolt on the mining planet, the Hegemony and Persean League struggled to seize the whole system, but Nepheria proved to resilient enough to retain its independence. The station is now a Hegemony outpost acting as a diplomatic ground with the nearby Tri-Tachyon and Persean League presence.",,,
planet_nirut,CUSTOM,"Nirut is the fruit of planetary terraforming at its best. It was nearly habitable when the Gates closed, with only a few thousand people present on the planet. They had to live isolated for tens of cycles before being rediscovered by the Hegemony. Despite its low population, the planet is valued and heavily guarded against potential invasion by Tri-Tachyon or raids from Luddic Church extremists based on Barra.",,,
