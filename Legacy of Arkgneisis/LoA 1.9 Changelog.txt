- Updates the mod to Starsector 0.95a RC12

- Breaks, and then fixes, version checker compatability, you will be unable to check your install's version of LoA until you have updated to V1.9

- Totally re-worked campaign mechanics for the Anarakis Reparations Society, they will now exist out of procedurally generated bases in unoccupied systems, as well as one special market.

- New Market condition for all ARS markets: Raid Economy: Fills the market with a selection of equipment and ships from all factions the ARS are at war with.

	- MODDERS: By default, this mechanic utilizes your Prism CSV settings to determine what is whitelisted, a seperate CSV is available in the files if
		you wish these settings to be different, mods with neither CSV are considered blacklisted and your equipment will not show up in ARS markets.

- New Industry: Void Extraction: Provides an income of all basic resources (Ore, Rare ore, Food, Volatiles, Organics) In exchange for ship hulls and heavy 		machinery. Posesses a base output that makes it quite good on small markets with poor resource conditions, but scaling with market size
		is exceptionally bad compared to farming/mining. Is also unaffected by planetary resource conditions (good or bad).

- New Structure: Orbital Station (ARS) and its upgrades. A new station type utilized by the ARS, largely lowtech in doctrine, and build by stringing together 				several asteroids. These stations are buildable by the player.

- ARS Markets can now be destroyed by engaging the relevant orbital station in direct combat.

- Destroyed ARS markets will be rebuilt at a new location after a time, this makes the faction effectively unkillable unless certain conditions are met.

- The Thatcher light destroyer and all variants have been renamed to the Taylor class. Yes this choice is politically motivated, bite me.

- Added a new, hidden ship to the ARS Roster.

- Numerous minor balancing tweaks to various Exodus Initiative hulls.

- The Shield Lance line of weapons have had their damage values increased.

- The Electron Rifle line of weapons have had their damage values increased.

- The Bulldog line of weapons have had their rate of fire increased, as well as a tweak to their flux stats and a slight reduction in the Bulldog's range.

- The Champion class cruiser is now the Lancer class cruiser, because Alex is a doo doo head >:(

- Other minor balancing tweaks to REDACTED content.

- Probably forgetting something, it's been a long update cycle.
