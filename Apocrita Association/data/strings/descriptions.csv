#SHIPS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
bee_osmia,SHIP,"The Osmia is a simple, speedy and economical frigate that is commonly seen in Association light patrol fleets. While it is not likely to break any records with its frail hull and light but versatile weapon mounts, it’s still a serviceable scout and picket ship.

Some joke that the Osmia is better at running away than fighting, but the harassment and distraction it provides is very much appreciated by the crews of allied ships. ",,,,
bee_osmia_p,SHIP,"Trading some mobility for additional firepower, the Osmia (P) has been turned from an agile scout into a lightweight brawler. Though still fragile, the offensive power provided by its ammo-feeder, ballistic mount conversion and extra missile slot makes it a risky ship to ignore.

   ",,,,
bee_halict,SHIP,"Focused on missiles, the Halict could be seen as a competitor to the Vigilance. While limited to small mounts, it has a built-in missile autoforge and is more capable of defending itself or continuing to fight once its payload has been fired.

Though it is a generally unassuming ship, a small, post-collapse polity like the Apocrita Association beginning to produce an as of yet unseen frigate-sized ship with an autoforge system has certainly turned some heads during the Association’s early days. Despite that, nowadays the humble Halict is mostly ignored when discussing the Association’s unique ship designs in favour of rarer, more notorious hulls.",,,,
bee_halict_e,SHIP,"This variant of the Halict was designed as an export to the Persean League. With more alpha-strike ability at the cost of sustainability, it is a somewhat more self-sufficient alternative to the Vigilance, with an additional support package to make it more competitive. 

As a hull built for export, it has slightly lower-quality armour plating and uses cheaper engine and shield components, though this results in only a marginal drop in combat effectiveness.",,,,
bee_zethus,SHIP,"Designed to be a fast and compact carrier, the Zethus allows even small picket fleets to field fighters without having to rely built-in drones like the Shepherd or Tempest. 

Being one of the simplest and most straightforward “blueprint-hacked” ships, the Zethus is at times criticized as a waste of the technology, as supposedly any shipyard could construct such a vessel out of decommissioned Drover parts. Yet, they do not.",,,,
bee_synoeca,SHIP,"The surprisingly advanced Synoeca is a powerful frigate that is heavily optimized for anti-armour missile alpha strikes.

Given only to the most loyal and experienced captains, the Synoeca’s internal autoforges and advanced electronics are quite difficult and expensive to maintain, but its offensive potential is deemed well worth it the cost. Believed to be fully designed by an AI, this vessel has been subject of some scrutiny but the Apocrita Association denies all accusations, however unconvincingly. As the pride of the Association’s fleets, it is often compared to the small but deadly creatures that live in the jungles of Apocrita itself. 
",,,,
,,,,,,
bee_xyloc,SHIP,"Combining aspects of a mining vessel and a warship, the Xyloc is a fairly agile light destroyer built around what is essentially a very large mining laser. It is fragile and has no sustainable way of breaking enemy shields, but can quickly chew through armour and hull, so deploying it with proper support is advised.",,,,
bee_sceliphron,SHIP,"A dangerous long-range destroyer armed with a large ballistics mount and ammo-feeder system, the Sceliphron was the first known vessel created by the Apocrita Association's ""blueprint-hacking"" technology.

The Sceliphron lives and dies by its large gun, and has ample support systems to keep it running. While it has impressive firepower, it is vulnerable to flanking, and may need escorts to reach its full potential.
",,,,
bee_ceraphron,SHIP,"Based on heavily-armoured low-tech hulls, the Ceraphron is essentially a tough missile platform. Despite its relative lack of sustainable firepower it is a tough nut to crack, and has enough sting to deter most smaller pirate groups.

Though its flux-grid is downsized due to space needed for missile-storage, its integrated damper field system helps it endure for long enough to fire all of its munitions in most battles.",,,,
bee_ceraphron_p,SHIP,"While still heavily armoured for a destroyer, this pirate refit of the Ceraphron traded away the defenses afforded by the damper field generator for souped-up engines and burn-drive capable thrusters. 

There are few strategies pirates love more than going really fast and launching a lot of missiles, and that’s exactly what they made this ship excel in, at the detriment of nearly everything else. ",,,,
bee_mutill,SHIP,"With a high flux capacity and a “fortress shield”-system, the Mutill is a hardy heavy destroyer that is able to contend with some cruisers, with maintenance costs to match. 

Being a highly advanced design, the Mutill was a chief cause behind the accusations that the Apocrita Association was using AI cores to design ships. Indeed, the ship’s engines are its only component that is recognizably derived from components used by other known designs, with all else being largely unknown. Due to the ship’s price and high maintenance costs it is a rare sight in the sector, mostly used by high-ranking officials and elite task-forces.",,,,
,,,,,,
bee_vespul,SHIP,"The Vespul is an average, well-rounded cruiser that is a common sight in Association fleets due to their lack of more specialized alternatives. Being rather fast and maneuverable, it can be counted on to swiftly reach the front-lines and engage the enemy, but may falter if forced to engage without support for too long.

",,,,
bee_polistes,SHIP,"Equipped with a powerful Aurifer Cannon, the Polistes is a versatile attack cruiser that poses a threat to any vessel. While average in most other regards, its unique armament and flux recycling system allow for powerful burst attacks, making it a dangerous opponent. Despite its high offensive potential however, reckless captains often cause it to overload or otherwise overexpose itself due to its main armament’s rapid flux-generation.",,,,
bee_polistes_e,SHIP,"Built specifically to export to the Persean League, the Polistes (E) swaps out its signature Aurifer Cannon for a modular energy mount, allowing the use of other weapons in conjunction with the flux recycler. Although as an export hull it has been constructed with slightly weaker materials and more common components, it remains a deadly and versatile ship.",,,,
bee_cteno,SHIP,"Filling the heavy-cruiser role in the Apocrita Association’s navy, the Cteno is a mainstay of defense and heavy patrol fleets in their systems. While it is best at engaging enemies head-on with its respectable armament, its interdictor array enables it to damage or shut down a target’s engines, preventing them from leaving its frontal arc, or enabling other ships to flank them more easily.",,,,
,,,,,,
bee_mound,SHIP,"Constructed from obsolete station parts, the Mound is little more than a huge drone autofactory with the purpose of overwhelming the enemy with swarms of unmanned fighters, with few ways to protect itself on its own. 

The original Mound was hastily designed as a capital carrier that can be quickly assembled from the leftover components of old, decommissioned orbital stations in order to help defend the Association during its early days. Those old models now have all been refitted with modern shield-generators and shifted focus on drone-production over regular fighters. Though it was originally made for quick and cheap construction, the growing scarcity of parts from those old stations in the core worlds resulted in its logistical costs being the same as any other battleship.",,,,
bee_urocerus,SHIP,"Armed with a powerful spinal Vivax Plasma Launcher and microburn system, the Urocerus treads the line between battlecruiser and battleship.

Originally believed to be a high-end example of the Association's blueprint-hacking, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation has raised claims that the Urocerus is an illegally modified variant of one of their designs that was lost during the Collapse. The Apocrita Association denied these claims and was not discovered to have any blueprints for the alleged original design, although given to the Association's method of editing and overwriting blueprints to create new designs, the TTC remains adamant in its accusation.  ",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
bee_chalice,SHIP,"Following the success of the Paragon, some high-ranking Tri-Tachyon executives wished to create a hammer to its anvil; an agile battleship with great offensive potential but without the fragility of a battlecruiser. The Chalice was meant to fulfil such a role, although it was still in the initial testing stages during the Collapse, leaving only a single built prototype. 

The prototype Chalice is an odd battleship. Due to its relatively weak engines, it relies on an upgraded, cutting-edge plasma burn system, and has a powerful spinal beam cannon for offense. Still, these features have their own flaws that could not be fixed before the Collapse. The engines’ delicate components particularly vulnerable to collision while stressed, and even with its dedicated capacitors, the spinal cannon essentially fries itself after three shots, requiring extensive repairs. 

In the hands of a skilled captain, the Chalice is an extremely dangerous vessel, despite its shortcomings.",,,,
bee_belcher,SHIP,"Cobbled together by pirates in some hidden shipyard, the Belcher has changed captains many times over the years. The ship’s most distinguishing feature is its bomb-bay, a set of flight decks and fighter autofactories that have been repurposed for making and releasing a large number of flak canisters.

Thanks to its unique armament, the Belcher can destroy any missiles and fighters in its frontal arc all at once, though a more daring captain may also use it against a vulnerable ship to finish them off with a barrage of explosions.",,,,
,,,,,,
#FIGHTERS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
bee_phrag,SHIP,"The Phrag is a support drone made to provide point-defense for the Mound. Armed with a pair of Vulcan cannons and a flare launcher, it makes short work of most missiles and fighters, but has little use against larger craft.",,,,
bee_alate,SHIP,"The Alate is essentially a souped-up Wasp drone with a shield generator and a pair of light machine-guns instead of a point-defense laser. While it is easily replaced en-masse by the dedicated autoforges of the Mound, it is uneconomical for other ships, thus LPCs of it are rarely produced.",,,,
bee_brachypter,SHIP,"Armed with a lighter version of the Tristis Pulse Gun, the Brachypter can pose a threat to both shields and armour, but may struggle to do much against larger targets.",,,,
,,,,,,
#WEAPONS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
bee_combusta,WEAPON,"A blueprint-hacked design, the Combusta is made to work as both a mining tool and potent combat weapon, but is too inefficient for feasible modular use. Instead, its flux systems are permanently merged with the Xyloc’s, enabling it to be more flux-efficient.",,,,
bee_aurifer,WEAPON,"A versatile burst-fire energy blaster designed by the Apocrita Association. At first it appears to be a large derivative of the heavy blaster, but a closer inspection at its internals reveals a wholly original design.",,,,
bee_vivax,WEAPON,"The Vivax is a large plasma launcher designed to fit the spinal mount of the Urocerus. It is very slow-firing and flux-intensive, but also massively destructive.

While the Vivax is integrated into the hull of the Urocerus, closer inspection reveals several discrepancies between its internals and the rest of the ship’s. Some, (particularly the TTC legal department) take this as a sign that the weapon and the ship were designed at different times, by different parties.",,,,
bee_aculeus,WEAPON,"A short-range, guided missile launcher with an autoloader system. Firing in bursts of three, the missiles excel in stripping armour, but are vulnerable to flak fire.",,,,
bee_nitor,WEAPON,"The prototype Nitor Particle Lance is an extremely powerful weapon. Designed to blast through armour and even overpower shields, it generates a ridiculous amount of flux. Though its built-in capacitors lessen the otherwise prohibitive load on the Chalice’s flux-grid, the strain on its components renders it inoperable after 3 shots.",,,,
,,,,,,
bee_atrox,WEAPON,"Fires a volley of energy blasts over a relatively long distance for an energy weapon, but lacks the ability to apply constant pressure to shields.",,,,
bee_tristis,WEAPON,"A miniaturized version of the Atrox, the Tristis fires long-range energy blasts at a medium rate.",,,,
,,,,,,
bee_exsecta,WEAPON,"Launches a burst of deadly anti-shield shells in a spread from a single, specialized barrel. The cannon’s internal autoloader struggles to keep up with its fire rate and may need some time to catch-up.",,,,
,,,,,,
bee_mandibula,WEAPON,"The Mandibula MRM is a heavy modification of the Salamander, seeking out the target’s engines to unleash a high-powered explosion. Though the missile is not particularly fast and is easily blocked by wide shields or fast turns, the high payload harshly punishes ships without sufficient point-defense and may prove a fatal distraction for others.",,,,
bee_aculeus_pod,WEAPON,"Fires a burst of short-range, homing missiles that rip through light armour with ease. Often considered the Swarmer’s big brother, Aculeus missiles are designed to be fired at larger ships as opposed to fighters, with a focus of high speed and tracking. ",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
#OTHER,,,,,,
,,,,,,
fluxrecycling,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Recycles a portion of flux produced by energy weapons to power them, decreasing their net flux generation and increasing their rate of fire.",,,,
enhancedmicroburn,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Provides a brief engine boost, propelling the ship forward at an extreme velocity. ",,,,
droneforge,SHIP_SYSTEM,Deploys additional drones that can fight for a short time before returning to the carrier. Can temporarily raise the number of deployed fighters above the maximum wing size. ,,,,
belch,SHIP_SYSTEM,Fires a large number of high-explosive flak canisters in front of the ship.,,,,
apocrita_association,FACTION,"The Apocrita Association is an alliance of formerly independent planets, formed for protection following the Askonia Crisis and the destruction of Opis. Currently, the Association seeks to establish itself as a major faction, starting with expanding its industrial capabilities and military might to protect itself from the more opportunistic parts of the sector.

While blueprint-hacking is generally a long and arduous process when it comes to even minor modifications, a lucky find during a tech-mining operation left them with the means to modify and mix-together blueprints to the point of creating entirely new designs. Due to the rate at which the Association began to field new and unseen hulls, they have been repeatedly accused of the use of AI that is illegal under Domain law, although most of these designs are not drastically more effective than most human-designed vessels. ",,,,
,,,,,,
planet_apocrita,CUSTOM,"Covered largely in lush jungles, much of Apocrita’s native life is derived from Old Earth’s stinging insects. While initial colonization has been made difficult by territorial swarms, by now the populace at large has learned how to live with them, which is seen as a point of national pride, an indicator of the Apocritan people’s hardy nature. ",,,,
planet_ymenn,CUSTOM,"Initially a small mining colony, Ymenn’s infrastructure evolved over time to become a decently-sized industrial world. Now it is dotted with strip mines and like arteries, pipelines pump molten minerals to fuel industrial complexes. ",,,,
planet_oruss,CUSTOM,"Oruss is a habitable, though resource-sparse planet housing a small, relatively young colony. While on its own it had little to provide, it joined the Apocrita Association for protection, as the faction was desperate for more constituent worlds to be taken seriously as a new power in the sector.",,,,
