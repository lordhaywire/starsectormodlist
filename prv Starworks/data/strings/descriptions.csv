### prv Frigates,,,,,
#############################,,,,,
prv_kite,SHIP,"Remodeled to carry a wing of escort drones instead of a gun turret, this shuttle features an impressively optimized flight deck complete with a miniature manufactory.

A familiar civilian design, the ""Kite""-class aeroshuttle is the day-to-day reminder of Fabrique Orbitale's reputation for aeronautical engineering- a valuable specialty even in the age of space travel. This compact space/aircraft is streamlined for efficient atmospheric flight and boasts a grid of cleverly distributed short-burst maneuvering thrusters coordinated by a delta-level AI subsystem to ensure smooth landings (a point driven home by Fabrique marketing by way of amusing ad-holos featuring a well-dressed couple and an overfull wine glass). The Kite has powerful engines for a civilian ship of its size, though zero-G maneuverability leaves something to be desired when the special subsystem is not engaged.

In the dangerous cycles post-Collapse, the Kite has been outfitted with a defense turret in place of the executive-class viewing dome and the two auxiliary jet-pods are replaced with missile systems (which do not need to draw on the limited powerplant). It won't stand up in a fair fight, but the Kite can be given unexpectedly sharp teeth and use its speed to escape from raiders. Luddic Path radicals have even been known to use modified Kite to deliver strike weapons against helpless freighters, followed by engaging the maneuvering subsystem to make a swift exit to avoid the wrath of their victim's escort.",,,
prv_gnista,SHIP,"Built to support larger ships, the Gnista ensures missile superiority through a combination of once-cutting-edge active flares, light point defense, and its own missile armaments. The ship is unlikely to end many fights on its own, however.

An older prv model, the Gnista was built as a competing offering to the Vigilance frigate. Though it was rejected by the Domain navy, the prv still managed to salvage the program by competing on price, successfully selling the ships to a number of smaller polities in need of cheap patrol craft.

Though not the most common ship in the sector, after hundreds of cycles travelling the starlanes on all sides of the law the Gnista is a tried and true ship with its flaws and virtues known to most spacers.",,,
prv_ljus,SHIP,"A sensor frigate built for long patrols in the far reaches of space. In addition to a state-of-the-art detection suite the Ljus also carries a modest armament.

After numerous convoy losses to unknown parties prv Starworks started development of a picket ship capable of providing early detection and warning against incoming raids. Priorities were excellent sensor strength, high endurance for extended patrols in both regular and hyperspace, and combat damage avoidance in convoy defense. Breadth of armament, tactical speed, and core structural integrity were considered secondary goals at best.

Combat survivability was achieved in two ways, one very simple and one very complicated. First, additional armor plating was applied to the hull (but not, some will note, the sensor arrays). For its thin frame and small size the Ljus is surprisingly well armored. Second, a deal was struck with the Tri-Tachyon Corporation for them to develop a delta-tier AI system that allows the Ljus to reconfigure its deep space sensor array to instead increase combat targeting range. This ”Lykta” system allows the Ljus to support fellow ships from outside the range of most threatening strike weapons found in the sector.

The advanced sensor array has proven to be very susceptible to battle damage, leading to a generous amount of (D)-grade hulls being available for purchase across the sector.",,,
prv_ljus_lp,SHIP,"A sensor frigate sans sensors, this ship is dedicated to bringing the light of Ludd unto the unbelievers by means of a nose-mounted Hammer launcher. Extremely threatening for as long as the magazine lasts.",,,
prv_flamma,SHIP,"A patrol frigate that revels in being the biggest ship in the smallest engagements, the Flamma is a natural companion to the Ljus frigate on local patrols. Offering energy or missile firepower and a potent gravitic shield the Flamma outmuscles the typical frigate while still being fast enough to outpace destroyers and larger ships. That's the ideal, anyway. Proponents call it a pocket destroyer, while detractors dismiss it as a ”fat, lazy cow”. 

While generally unassuming, the Flamma is quietly regarded as the second pillar of the prv, being the first mass-line ship with a graviton-manipulation system. As a technological and doctrinal springboard it has led to a silent revolution in the corporation’s direction.

Readily available and generally competent, the Flamma’s quiet work supporting the rest of the fleet often comes out to be the glue that keeps the prv house of cards together.",,,
prv_gryning,SHIP,"A light and agile frigate equipped with light armaments and a time-warping device that lets it - in effect - speed up the local flow of time by a noticeable percentage and maintain this level for significant periods of time.

Public records about the history of this ship are exceedingly scarse. What little there is suggests that the Temporal Core is reverse-engineered from a Tri-Tachyon ship, and that the prv failed to maintain the same tach-field precision levels as the Scarab, having to settle for a low-potency but longer-lasting generator.

In the prv the Tachyon Workers' Union (motto: ""Live fast, die old"") recently lost a case concerning whether work hours should be counted based on subjective time or standard time - the ""Time and a half"" case, as the public would call it. The final statement of the court concluded that ""[...] even though work can feel like it drags on forever, this does not change the fact that we have materially objective and reliable timekeeping devices which are more than sufficient at giving us a common frame of reference for the passage of time. Furthermore, this court obeys the laws of causality in accordance with Domain statutes.""

Many temporal academics have objected to the ruling, but arguments about why it would be mistaken tend to get bogged down in solipsism or outright rejection of the possibility of shared frames of reference.",,,
prv_sinne,SHIP,"A fast attack frigate equipped with advanced Domain-era technologies, the Sinne’s powerful flux lines enable it to stand up to even light cruisers in direct combat. A deadly ship by any measure.

The Sinne was undergoing final trials at the time of the gate system collapse, representing some of the finest work the prv had ever done. This rude interruption of all known society caused some delays in the development of the ship. Now rescued from the deep archives of Kratul Heavy Industries by a dedicated development team, the Sinne is finally ready to make its mark on the sector; an impertinent youth from a lost era.

prv leadership were somewhat concerned when they found out that their TriPads had contained a largely accurate technical readout since long before they were even aware that the project’s data archives had survived into the post-collapse.",,,
prv_fasnod,SHIP,"Disruptive to the extreme, the Fasnod's reason for existence is to wreak havoc on enemy battle cohesion. A quick flanker in itself, the Fasnod also carries a light phase teleporter used to deploy gravity mines. Only the most solid fleets can maintain their formation against a determined gravity mine attack.

Fasnod ship insignias often include cats, for their fondness of toying with their prey. Experienced crews have been known to hit vulnerable ships many times in a row with well-planned mine strikes, rebounding the target from one mine to another. Others have directed light ships into their heavier comrades, with devastating results.",,,
prv_fasnod_p,SHIP,"A fast hunting frigate, adept at ganging up on isolated targets. One of the more advanced hulls to end up in pirate hands.

Among the many things that were lost during the collapse were one of the prv’s Fasnod production chips, which a senior technician absconded with in the general confusion of the first century of the collapse. 

It is unclear where - and with whom - the chip itself ended up, but it was likely on an industrial world as a large batch of Fasnods quickly made their way to pirate hands. The ramifications were however not quite as dire as sector legal authorities first feared, as the blueprint did not include the production codes for the ship’s gravity mine teleporter. 

Mass production ceased after a few cycles. It is suspected that prv agents from Pariabyrån managed to track down the deserter. There is still a trickle of hulls of dubious quality being produced in fringe workshops. Experienced appraisers can easily tell the difference through to a tell-tale flange replacement that is not present in the mass-produced series.",,,
prv_ande,SHIP,"Not, strictly speaking, a ship in itself, the Ande is an integrated system that allows a group of fighters to both coordinate and strenghten and reinforce each other using a swarm of nanites.

The swarm intelligence of an Ande is very poor, and rarely reaches even low delta levels. As an ”instinctual” system it does however function quite well while operating within its pre-set design scenarios. Most notably, the system allows the fighter swarm to coordinate their engine emitters and jump into hyperspace, something that generally requires at least a corvette-sized craft.

The logistical abilities of an Ande could be generously described as ”limited”, and largely consists of a few specialized containers carried by the fighters. The towed crew cabins are known for being very cramped, but surprisingly comfortable.

Integrated swarms are maintained by their fighter wings; if enough of the fighters are destroyed at once, the entire swarm system fails.",,,

#############################,,,,,
prv_damm,SHIP,"A shuttle craft common in Ruster space. The Damm can carry light cargo loads or small groups of people, and also carries a multitool array and a tug-line fastener. Ideal for everyday tasks that are beyond a Buddy drone.

Supposedly there exists a pattern for installing a furnace on the Damm that smelts a single standard industrial ore grain at a time. Combined with a mining laser, a family could probably make a living off of that…",,,
prv_skiffer,SHIP,"One of the primary economic engines of the belt, these small craft recycle and reuse the leftovers of life (and death) in space. Capable of cutting up and carting off larger ships in remarkably short time, the Skiffer is ubiquitous in Ruster space. To assist in the work, the Skiffer can carry a group of utility drones, or if safety is a bigger concern than usual, a wing of armed fighter craft.",,,
prv_basalt,SHIP,"By all appearances chiseled out of a mountain, the Basalt is a sturdy combat frigate popular with the more well-organized Rust Belt militias. Held back somewhat by a sub-par flux system and limited uptime on the orientation thrusters.

Much of the innards of the Basalt are dedicated to a generous cargo hold, and it is not uncommon for the ship to be used as an armed courier in the ’freer’ parts of the sector.",,,
prv_skara,SHIP,"Scrapyard salvage of the best kind has been gathered to build this rugged and feisty combat frigate. It is armed with an assortment of smaller weapons and with a potent shock emitter mounted on the port side. Although the Skära is a relatively common ship in the belt, owning one still commands a fair bit of respect. It is regarded as a solid ship, for respectable freebooters.

Sporting more creature comforts than most combat ships, Skära officers rarely have trouble finding willing crewmen. The standard non-standard mish-mash interior does cut deep in the heart of the more fashionably inclined however. But some of those seats are real pleather, man. That ain't bad.

On the side of the hull there is mounted a reclaimed beam weapon; no longer functional in its original role but full of power coils, flux vanes and other goodies that can be coaxed to transfer extreme currents. Once a splendor of the technology of man, this beam weapon now serves as a glorified spark plug.",,,
prv_gremlin_rb,SHIP,"A Gremlin with a burnt-out phase coil is not much of a combat ship - but there's still a respectable power generator inside the hull. With some ingenuity, a donor hulk, and a lot of welding, this can be used to power a major energy weapon and a shield generator. Waste not, want not.

If possible, the Rust Belt modification is even less comfortable than the original model Gremlin - but at least the phase coil is gone now. Spontaneous illness in the crew is down 80%.",,,
prv_gremlin_rb_rare,SHIP,"Some people would claim that this heavily modified Gremlin is in fact a lightly modified Apogee. Such people are fools, imbeciles with no vision and no sense of greatness.

One of many ambitious one-off models found in the Rust Belt, this ship appears to be built out of the best, or possibly worst, parts of a Ruster-pattern Gremlin and an Apogee. The immense generator of the science ship is used to power an appropriately oversized battery of energy weapons. The endeavor seems to have left the ship’s main flux transport somewhat exposed.",,,

#############################,,,,,
prv_tystnad,SHIP,"The final product of an experimental miniaturized combat carrier program by Kratul Spacewharfs. The Tystnad is a support ship through-and-through with only moderate direct firepower but the versatility to carry a wide array of support fighters and drones. 

The primary armament of the Tystnad is a ballistic battery located in the aft of the ship. This is complemented with a wing of support fighters, generally Oväsen models, and a group of slaved missile drones. Protection comes in the form of a narrow but efficient omni-shield and a barebones layer of hallbar armor honeycomb.

One of the many compromises involved in fitting a flight deck onto such a small ship is that the hangar carries only the bare necessities to operate its integrated wing of fighters and can only replace a few combat losses before exhausting itself. Additionally it can only be adjusted to fly more offensive fighter craft with difficulty, as the default configuration is focused on close ship/fighter integration over more independent operations.

The ship is infamous among Persean crews for having a tendency of breaking in half when struck laterally. There is a persistent rumor of an unnamed captain who replaced the rear PD mounts with Antimatter Blasters and caused a mutiny through his habit doing close-range assaults in order to bring them to bear. 

The prv consider the same configuration to be standard issue.",,,
prv_eld,SHIP,"An agile and flexible destroyer that can be outfitted for most mission profiles. Its advanced tensor drive gives it a somewhat ”bursty” movement pattern. In the prv officers are often given command of an Eld very early in their careers, as a trial by fire and as an excellent way for a young talent to prove themselves. Attrition rates tend to be high, but the officers that complete their assignments often do go on to become the naval elite.

There are many differing opinions on how the Eld is best utilized, from the conservative Elite school who believe that range and kinetics are the key to dictating a battle, to the reckless captains who prefer to redline all their equipment, firm in their belief that there’s no such thing as a best defense against a well-tuned plasma drive. The opinions of the Missile Corps are obvious, debates on torpedoes versus guided missiles aside. There are also the Hunter cadres, a little-spoken-of group who utilize gravitonic equipment to isolate enemy support ships and defeat them in detail.",,,
prv_ballebo,SHIP,"A mostly forgotten ship, the Ballebo was once the prv’s flagship model destroyer. It never achieved any particularly impressive production numbers however, and by now the ship is largely a footnote in the company histories.

Normally a fairly slow ship, the Ballebo's engine core is configured to generate and store excess plasma, which can then be expelled through a set of maneuvering jets located on the sides of the ship, greatly increasing speed and agility for a limited time. ",,,
prv_fasklot,SHIP,"The Fasklot is a speedy ship ideal for punishing distracted opponents. A light phase teleporter allows it to deploy groups of EMP mines to cripple its targets.

Generally thought of as dishonorable to the extreme - as if there’s such a thing as honor when men try to destroy each other. Fasklot crews are well aware of their reputation, and will ask no quarter. Certainly none would be given to a craft specialized in killing the disarmed.",,,
prv_brand,SHIP,"One of the rare examples of technological advancement in the sector, this ship combines high-quality components from the height of the Domain-era with more recent advancements in gravitonics and drive technology in order to offer a deadly hunter-killer craft.

The Brand utilizes a late Domain-era shield emitter and power generator in combination with a potent gravitic field emitter and a few well-applied techniques from the prv’s tensor drives. Combined with a heavy energy weapon, the Brand offers a level of performance that could have seen it operating in the core worlds of the Domain. Or at least, it might have by standards 200 cycles past.

Production of new Brands is difficult and generally stalls when it’s time to install the reactor. Finding usable Antima-Re/87s has proven to be challenging to say the least, and to the best of anyone’s knowledge there exists no still-functioning production chips for it, or any compatible model, in the sector. Indeed as the few Brand captains are well aware, even simple wear-and-tear parts for it such as 304kWb flux catalysers are becoming increasingly elusive.",,,
prv_sorl,SHIP,"A relatively well-armed support carrier that reliably outperforms the ”flying landing strip” models so common in the sector, but is in turn significantly more expensive to maintain and field.

Dissenting voices in the prv often question the wisdom in operating the Sorl. The question asked is if it would not be better to field three Condor auxiliaries instead of two Sorl. Satisfying answers are few, and between political inertia and the potential cost of retooling the manufactory the Sorl production line keeps chugging along.",,,
prv_sunder_ryak,SHIP,"This Sunder has been heavily modified at the Ryak High-Energy Labs to serve as a test platform for advanced sensor and armaments projects. It now carries a powerful ballistic suite backed up by light missile or energy armaments.

Originally a technologically advanced yet fragile destroyer from the late Domain era designed to provide additional firepower in fleet actions carried out by the stretched Domain Navy rather than serve on independent patrols. It had powerful shield emitters and energy weapons, now replaced with a powerful ballistic battery, and retains its vulnerability to strike craft and flanking assault frigates. 

An early-model Siege Akers has been built into the hull and a shield drawline bypass has allowed for a hypercryogenic feedsystem to be installed in the ship, at the cost of shield coverage and generator performance. The ~0-K cooling enable the ballistic armaments to be overcharged immensely for a shot or two. The extensive structural changes also allowed the ship's armor to be augmented substantially.",,,
prv_gast,SHIP,"Not, strictly speaking, a ship in itself, the Gast is a vast integrated system that allows a large group of fighters to both coordinate and strenghten and reinforce each other using a swarm of nanites. The bot swarm also includes weapon elements, enabling it to take minor offensive action.

The swarm intelligence of a Gast is poor, and rarely reaches even middling delta levels. It has however shown a curious tendency to bond to its pilots. In a few cases, after sustaining heavy fighter losses Gasts have been known to refuse further combat orders entirely. For the swarm to regain combat effectiveness prv service technicians had to replace the fighter-side neural coordinators and retrain the system from scratch.

Integrated swarms are maintained by their fighter wings; if enough of the fighters are destroyed at once, the entire swarm system fails.",,,

prv_gnejs,SHIP,"A straight-forward and practical destroyer. When it comes to bringing heavy firepower at a low cost, few ships can beat the Gnejs. However the ship carries a somewhat poor reputation due to its exceedingly weak point defense mounts.",,,
prv_gnejserhead,SHIP,"This mutt of a ship combines the heavy cannon mounts of a Gnejs with the rear half of a Hammerhead destroyer. It is surprisingly fast for its heritage, likely due to shedding some gun mounts and armor while forcing the engines well past their rated performance envelope.",,,
prv_gissel,SHIP,"Built out of select salvage hulls by a few in-the-know shipbreakers, the Gissel offers a competent combat destroyer for those without access to more mainstream arms traders. Carrying a blink displacer, a motley but competent armaments lineup and a hefty armor belt this ship is a not too rare sight in the fringes of the sector.

Maintaining compartmentalization and structural integrity while cutting up and reassembling scrap hulks is challenging, and often comes at the expense of the humans who have to crew the ships. The Gissel is infamous for its byzantine and sometimes outright bizarre internal layout, where moving to the compartment on the other side of a firewall can involve a trip straight across the ship.

What used to be a flight deck has been replaced with a bulky missile system that feeds magazines of Skatunge missiles into launchers, while the old fighter command & control electronics have been retasked for ECCM, enhancing missile guidance and protecting the main batteries from EW disruption. Few destroyers in the sector have better fire control than these rusty hulks.",,,
prv_bitumen,SHIP,"An armored tanker that suggests more combat ability than it offers in practice. Sometimes pressed into combat as a missile support platform.

For all its armor and weapon mounts, the Bitumen rarely does well in actual combat. Evidence of cost-cutting measures in the design are abundant, and the general opinion of the ship is that if you were to turn on a water kettle in the galley you’re more likely to blow a fuse on the bridge than to get hot water.",,,
prv_eld_rb,SHIP,"Though referred to as a ”petty mockery” by the prv Starworks corporation, the Rust Belt model of the Eld destroyer nonetheless finds itself as an appreciated ship among sector fringe elements, offering a competent mix of speed and firepower.

While the ship’s relationship to the prv Eld is evident at a glance, the Rust Belt model rebuilds large parts of the ship to be more suited for Outer Yard construction habits. This does result in it being cheaper to build, maintain and field, but leaves a noticable mark in the ship’s perfomance ratings due to a weaker generator and much more common frontal shield emitter - not to mention the complete lack of a tensor drive.

The Head4 syndicate claim that they produce the ship from a now-decrypted production chip stolen in a convoy raid. While outsiders have been unable to confirm the claims, it has been noted that the Old Wharf Eld production is down an average of 27% since the first Eldsjäl sighting was documented. According to the prv this reduction was done to shift production towards the Tystnad. 

Clear and credible sources supporting either side remain elusive.",,,

prv_is,SHIP,"Designed to hunt and disable high-value targets, the Is is equipped with a fearsome tachyon system and a potent strike weapon of choice. These days it is usually regarded as a ”high-value target” in itself.",,,
prv_flock,SHIP,"A somewhat fragile light cruiser with an integrated high-end missile launch system capable of launching sustained salvoes of Kråka MRM missiles. A limited number of hardpoints allow the ship to pair this with either a wide selection of missiles, or a more reliable suite of energy cannons.

One of the more popular fire support platforms of the prv, the Flock’s flexible automatic launcher allows for smooth transitions between harassing fire, saturation bombardment, and heavy strikes.",,,
prv_flock_midline,SHIP,"A somewhat fragile light cruiser built around a fast-cycle heavy missile mount. A limited number of hardpoints allow the ship to pair this with either a wide selection of missiles, or a more reliable suite of ballistics.",,,
prv_flock_rb,SHIP,"An extensive carrier conversion of the Flock missile cruiser, the Ruster model figures that if there's anything that's better than a big missile, it's two bomber wings.

Few Ruster ships are alike. The Flock conversions vary more than most, with the secondary flight deck moving about according to what resources were available when the conversion was done, and the state of the base hulk. On some ships the flight decks operate independently, each with its own maintenance facilities. Others have a combined hangar, and run one launch deck and one recovery deck. 

The debate about which is the superior variant seems never-ending, though the shipwrights building the ships seem to take it in strike; you work with the materials you’ve got and make the best of them.",,,
prv_flock_rare,SHIP,"This appears to be an attempt to imitate the ”Flock” light missile cruiser, constructed out of considerably cruder parts. A large custom missile launcher built into the center of the ship promises significant firepower, while an abundance of thrusters supply as much speed as the ship can handle - or possibly more.",,,
prv_kakafoni,SHIP,"Multirole cruiser that carries a wide gun or missile array and a moderate fighter complement. These ships effortlessly fit into just about any fleet, offering a somewhat defensive blend of firepower and durability.

Kakafoni cruiser-carriers carry two wings of fighters, a diverse armament and reasonable point defense. They are protected by a prv-characteristic narrow band omni-shield generator and a respectable armor belt. Maintenance costs are somewhat high due to the numerous different capabilities covered by the ship.

The ever-reliable rock in the storm, the anchor, the beating heart of prv battlefleets.",,,
prv_kakafoni_p,SHIP,Multirole cruiser that combines a heavy ballistic piece with fighters and lighter armaments. This ship has been run ragged over the years and the advanced teleportation system and integrated ramshield core have been swapped out for after-market replacement parts.,,,
prv_kakafoni_rb,SHIP,"Multirole cruiser combining missile pods, strike craft, and a heavy cannon into one intimidating package. A munitions autoforge ensures sustained firepower, making the (RB) model a very reliable ship for longer engagements.",,,
prv_aska,SHIP,"Imposing and terrifying, the Aska utilizes an enormous phase teleporter to move around the battlefield and hunt down opposing ships. Armed with an assortment of ballistic, energy and missile weapons this powerful cruiser is more than capable of taking down its prey.

The lumbering and bulky form of the ship belies the true speed it can move at. By stutterjumping up to eight times a minute the Aska can outpace most ships in the sector. Though, it must be admitted that the ship is not the most agile thing around - standard engine performance has taken second seat to the ability of teleportation, no doubt.

Built to do everything the Kakafoni does not, the Aska brings a punishing weapons array, capable of mounting the very largest missile and energy systems that can be found in the sector. Powerful, aggressive and destructive. One of the finest products of the spacewharfs at Kratul.",,,
prv_fasvinge,SHIP,A high-tech strike cruiser equipped with a rapid phase shift system operated by a dubiously legal AI. Seeing a Fasvinge in spite of its stealth fields is considered a bad omen by superstitious spacers; misfortune will follow.,,,
prv_valnad,SHIP,"Not, strictly speaking, a ship in itself, the Vålnad is a vast integrated system that allows a large group of fighters to both coordinate and strenghten and reinforce each other using a swarm of nanites. Much larger than other integrated swarm systems, the Vålnad has sufficient mass that it can be programmed to mimic most kinds of modular light energy weapons.

The decision to base the neural net of the Vålnad on a Labrador Retriever has resulted in the system being easily trained, eager, and moderately obedient. Its tendency to get overenthusiastic and overtaxing its flux systems has however led to the loss of several of the prototype systems. Alternative neural patterns are being investigated, such as the old earth octopus or the Kratul I rovälg.

Integrated swarms are maintained by their fighter wings; if enough of the fighters are destroyed at once, the entire swarm system fails.",,,

prv_hornfels,SHIP,"As immovable as the mountain, this indomitable ship can hold its ground against even capital-grade firepower. The deep hum of the fortress generator promises safety against even the most devastating attacks, while the sizable ballistic batteries allow for a potent second strike once the storm has been weathered.

Larger than most Ruster ships, the Hornfels is much sought-after and rarely are operating ships given time for overhauls. It’s not unheard of for Hornfels ships to dock and let off their crew, only to immediately take on an entirely new crew and undock to start a new deployment. Any required maintenance is then done while underway, to whatever extend possible. The only component given all time and resources asked for is the fortress generator.

It is a good thing these ships are rugged. More recent Domain models would by no means stand up to the treatment the Rusters give these run-ragged craft. The things you love the most always wear out first.",,,
prv_hornfels_pather,SHIP,"Adapted from the normally highly defensive Hornfels, the Path remodel retains little of the original’s characteristics - instead of a sturdy bulwark against to protect the free flock, it has been forged into a righteous sword to strike down the wicked. Little remains of its protective capabilities, and all systems are pushed to the point of failure in order to fire the ship’s arsenal without pause or delay.

prv naval intelligence have had some trouble tracking down how the Path are supplied with Hornfels hulls; the most popular theory is that any hulls with failed Fortress Generators are sold on the ship market in Baetis, at which point they are purchased by Path-aligned operatives within the Church itself. A politically sensitive quagmire, no doubt. Regardless, they are considered a moderate security threat, especially to the Ryak HEL, which has been explicitly named as a target due to ”continual and willful tech-heresy”.",,,
prv_dominator_rb,SHIP,"Ponderous and menacing, these Dominator-class remodels are among the most widespread military cruisers in Ruster space. Mostly built from long-lost Dominator hulks salvaged from the belts, the Rusters attempt to make these ponderous ships somewhat more flexible by installing plasma drive afterburners and converting a large ballistic mount to instead carry a heavy energy weapon; generally one of the ubiquitous Belt Blasters.

While not the most technologically advanced hull, it relies on a plethora of ballistic hardpoints to accomplish its mission, which is more often than not defending orbital installations and vital points of intra-system trade routes. A poor shield emitter which is difficult to manage and thus, rarely engaged, gives way to an almost impregnable interlocking armor belt system making the Dominator safe from most weapons. Even strike craft cannot overcome the hail of projectiles that can be launched to intercept their payloads. This hull proves that tried and true military engineering is difficult to overcome by new ideas and technologies, especially when in the hands of tough, determined crews and experienced officers.

Dependable, durable, and an ever-wished-for presence in home space around free stations and worlds, the Dominator (RB) serves as the professional backbone of Ruster defense fleets.",,,
prv_kvarts,SHIP,"Constructed around a group of presumably stolen phase coils and an equally suspect graviton core, the Kvarts may well be the most advanced ship operating in the belts - not that you could tell from its rough exterior.

prv_valljud,SHIP,"A lively combat carrier equipped with an underhanded disruption system, the Välljud is adept at delivering effective strikes against even the toughest targets. However, this offensive focus comes at the cost of durability and the ship will quickly fall to a determined assault.

The primary capital-class ship manufactured at the Works over Utbo. The prv top rungs used to regard the Välljud as somewhat of a failure - until an upgrade program equipped the class with the now infamous disruption zone generator, turning it into a disturbingly effective strike platform.",,,
prv_rok,SHIP,"As a matter of faith as much as doctrine, the prv believe that defenses are used to enable offensive action, a principle exemplified in the Rök, which carries heavy armaments and for a battlecruiser uncharacteristically strong defenses. The class is however also known for having a tendency to use up its entire flux capacity in a matter of seconds.

The class is considered a strategic-level threat by the Hegemony due to its powerful anti-ballistic gravity shield, and incidents of sabotage of the remaining Rök ships have become so common that the prv press no longer reports on it not for reasons of secrecy, but simply because ”dog bites man” is not news. At any given time several Rök are likely to be laid up for critical repair work - often waiting for parts that are increasingly impossible to get a hold of. The entire affair has led Pariabyrån - prv covert intelligence - to be considered entirely unreliable when it comes matters of counter-intelligence.",,,
prv_skymning,SHIP,"The largest ship operated by the prv, these behemoths carry a wide array of sophisticated weapons and fighters. The Skymning is built for head-on engagements and breaking up packs of smaller ships, and is fit with an integral tensor drive which gives the ship a highly dynamic engagement profile.

Unlike most prv ships the actual design of the Skymning significantly predates the collapse - and the enormity of the undertaking had the entire corporation struggling to stay solvent. When the time came to move from low-volume initial production to mass manufacturing, Domain politics turned against the project, which was characterized as wasteful and redundant. Funding was pulled. Most hulls that had been laid down had to be put in indefinite storage while the prv administration scrambled for funds to restart the production lines. The corporation was overleveraged, all contingencies had been used up, and the entire shipbuilding division was looking at dissolution. 

And then, the collapse happened. 

One of three Skymning production facilities was located in the now-isolated sector; the wharves orbiting Kratul. In spite of the logistical challenges brought on by the turmoil of the post-collapse, a number of Skymning battleships have been finished from previously laid-down hulls - a major factor behind the prv's waxing influence in the region.

The question of the corporation's outstanding debts remains unresolved. It is suspected that creditors will have to enforce any claims by force of arms.",,,
prv_conquest_ryak,SHIP,"This Conquest has been very heavily modified at the Ryak High-Energy Labs to serve as a test platform for an experimental armaments project. It now backs up its main broadside batteries with a powerful spinal-mount particle projector. Generally considered a somewhat awkward model.

The Conquest-class battlecruiser is the embodiment of concentrated firepower. Developed in the period just preceding the popularization of fighter craft, the class emphasizes firepower and speed over armor protection.

Space Naval tacticians of the day were confident that new weapons systems would always outperform armor and shields and thus were the key to winning an engagement. So why not build a ship for speed and power? Give it the armor protection of a cruiser, but arm it with the best weapons available to any ship, and have it remain faster than any of those lumbering behemoths of the line. The Conquest is a good example of these concepts put into a hull. Many other advanced technologies were incorporated into the design, including weapon mounts designed for a circling engagement. This maneuver requires greater navigational skill while serving to provide more tactical options to the commanding officers. 

Fortune favors the bold, the ancients said. This class of ships does indeed favor the bold captain, willing to risk everything for the thrill of victory.",,,

prv_andesit,SHIP,"The Great Belt Alliance's most recent capital ship class, though considering how much Ruster ships tend to vary, talking about classes may be stretching the definition. Regardless, technical information on the ships is scarce outside the prv, who are not forthcoming with what they have learned. Analysis of the few available combat recordings suggests that they rely on a mixture of fighter wings and missile armaments, and suffer from poor mobility.

Rusters are known for their habit of talking about things they should not, leading to a bevy of information on their ships. Equally, they are infamous for running their mouth even - especially - when they are completely clueless on the topic. Supposed capabilities of the Andesit class include a 120 LY hyperspace range, a phase cloak system, lower production costs than an Eagle cruiser, secret ""plasma afterburner tanks"", and thicker armor than a XIV-battlegroup Onslaught battleship. Dubious claims, to say the least.

What there is evidence for indicates a moderately armored ship with a focus on long-ranged support and a simple logistical profile. Claims that the ship has a high parts commonality with the Bergtagen class, but with a downgraded flux system, appear entirely plausible. The rampart-like armor layout plainly suggests a shared ancestry.",,,
prv_rok_p,SHIP,"It takes a brazen thief to steal a battlecruiser, but some madman has evidently managed to; this armored beast is constructed around the better part of a prv Rök. The ship may be somewhat worse for wear, but any pirate laying claim to a vessel like this is doubtlessly a warlord without peer.",,,
prv_bergtagen,SHIP,"An immense agglomeration of recovered, refurbished or rebuilt ship parts, this Ruster battleship has a main battery of almost unrivaled size - to the point where its relatively primitive fire control computers have trouble managing it all. The Bergtagen has been built to last and even should its hefty armor belts be breached the ship can take a remarkable amount of punishment before going down. Rarely seen outside of the Kratul belts.

Supposedly more Bergtagens have been lost in combat than were constructed in the first place - it is a testament to Ruster tenacity and ingenuity both that that they so often manage to reclaim their lost beasts. Standing prv doctrine is now to scuttle any wrecks using no fewer than five nuclear demolition charges.

Conceptually there exists a pristine Bergtagen that’s built entirely to-spec with no compromises in construction, all parts brand new and with its sleek, flawless armor belts covered in immaculate silver paint. What a horrible thing that would be, a soulless hunk of metal operated by expendable drones and thin-lipped leeches in tailored uniforms.",,,

Most fleet commanders in the sector scoff at the idea of sticking guns on a tanker. The prv disagree, and build the Tiger. Offering a capable combat platform with a sizable amount of well-protected fuel storage, the Tiger makes sure that the fleet comes home again.  Built in the same facilities as the Flamma frigate, the Tiger shares many structural parts with its smaller sibling and is designed entirely to military specifications.

The sector at large continues scoffing. The Tiger still finds a customer base however, as there are more than a few skippers who feel that a half-dozen machine guns just aren't enough to keep his fellow man honest in the depths of space.",,,

Built as an - excessive, according to some - response to prv Starworks's ongoing troubles with lost convoys, the Ilbud utilizes a sophisticated phase system to ensure that it will not be detected, intercepted, or destroyed by anything but the most involved and capable opposition. Ruinously expensive from a credits per cargo-lightyear perspective the Ilbud nonetheless offers the ability to transport just about anything, to just about anywhere, past just about anyone.

Neither pirates nor pathers nor heat nor gloom of space stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.",,,
prv_munsbit,SHIP,"The infamous egg. Munsbit freighters are small and reasonably economical freighters produced by the prv to cover their domestic transportation needs. Serving as an officer on one of these mundane ships tends to mark the end of a career, rather than the beginning of one.

While feared and loathed by the prv officer corps, the ship is incredibly popular with the rank and file - as a dedicated freighter the ship is unlikely to see direct combat, and the crew compartment is surprisingly large and comfortable. It is not uncommon for service placements on a Munsbit to be grey-market traded for several credits.",,,
prv_middag,SHIP,"As many prv ships the Middag straddles the line between ambitious and megalomanic - oversized and overarmed, this freighter is capable of standing up to most cruisers in the sector in direct combat. It is extravagant to a fault, and much too expensive for civilian shipping - or deployment in most navies, for that matter.

prv_gabbro,SHIP,"A passenger liner for a more volatile age, based on the Huan-Gogel 440 ”Starliner” and built to travel between the systems of the Persean sector in safety and security. The Gabbro features combat-rated armor, two additional thrusters, a pair of heavy gun turrets, and a sizable hydroponics bay to enable longer-term habitation on the ship.

The Gabbro maintains a wide forward shield to ensure safety in combat and protect the armor from routine high-explosives bombardment. Rebuilt for the current realities of the belt, this ship class is routinely utilized not only to move populations from combat zones and towards more secure habitats, but also function as line combatants, should the need arise.

It's unclear how many Starliners have been converted into Gabbros. The official estimate of the prv naval intelligence division is a little over a hundred, but persistent rumors claim the numbers are many times that, most supposedly utilized as moored habitats in various discrete hideaways. The possibility that there are tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of Rusters completely unaccounted for is a quiet source of great concern on Kratul II.",,,
prv_venture_rb,SHIP,"Happily modified for life on the rim, the tough and dependable Venture (RB) sports a larger cargo hold than the standard model and is generally regarded as being more of a long-haul freighter than anything else. Still, the ship carries several gun turrets and a pair of reliable Skatunge SRM launchers.

The Venture-class ships are perhaps the most widely used civilian cruisers in the Sector. Several Ruster modification packages have been made for it throughout its service in the belt, before this latest one - now approaching 150 cycles in age - finally stuck and became the dominant remodel.

When used by Rusters, the ship is usually a packmule trusted to carry trade goods to and fro without being threatened by opportunistic brigands. On the other side of the law, the vessel also serves with quite a few pirate outfits, where it sometimes fills the role of command ship.",,,

The Free State of Lasse was founded in c143, when the crew chief Lasse Sjöberg led a mutiny, protesting witheld pay and outrageous disciplinary punishments. Ever since, the ship has traveled from one end of the sector to the next, trading, salvaging, exploring, and seeing both the best and the worst of Persean space.

Over the years, the ship has been repaired, renovated, torn down and built up numerous times. The largest and costliest modification was the installation of a Thermal Pulse Cannon purchased from a very dubious ship parts dealer on Baetis. The most important modification was the application of 40 cubic meters of magenta paint, purchased on Volturn.",,,
prv_bergslag,SHIP,"An industrial goliath, this heavy vessel carries all the equipment needed to turn entire asteroids into processed metals. Rock goes into the grinders, tailings are dumped out the bottom, and the wealth stays within the ship.

Big fans of dual-use technology, the Rusters make sure that their mining equipment can function in combat, and the enlarged mining blaster installed on the ship is especially dangerous and more than enough to keep lone raiders away. Additionally, the drone bays are often fit with at least one wing of fighter craft to act as scouts and additional firepower. Generally lacking larger combat ships, the GBA routinely impress Bergslag ships into combat service.

Built for deployments lasting many months, the Bergslag has room for hundreds of crew and spare equipment for any occasion. Little short of total destruction can force the ship to turn back to port ahead of schedule.",,,
prv_bergslag_p,SHIP,"Rebuilt from an industrial goliath, this brigand vessel has replaced all civilian tooling with purely violent implements. With heavy arms, including a hefty ground support package, sturdy bulkheads, and several fighter wings, the only thing that keeps it from truly terrorizing the more independent parts of the sector is its sluggish speed and easily-identified drive signature.

Not the most common pirate ship, the Bergslag is mostly used as an ambush vessel - by hiding its weapons and posing as a distressed mining ship it tries to draw in other pirates to instead prey on them. This has turned out to be only moderately successful, and ultimately seems to have resulted in Bergslag-class ships being left alone on general principle.

Suggestions that this was the plan behind the Fe & Ox Ltd. syndicate’s (P)-model conversion all along are generally dismissed as fanciful and conspiratorical.",,,

prv_skran,SHIP,"Heavy interceptor focused on destroying other fighters. Armed with a single Akers heavy gun repeater and equipped with a Energized Reactive Field that can be activated to zap any hostile craft in extreme proximity.

Originally concepted as a ”one shot, one kill” platform, a full-size h41-calibre gun sadly proved too unweildy to fit on a fighter. The scaled-down version, while still punchy, falls short of the original goal. Nonetheless shielded or lightly armored fighters suffer greatly in combat with the Skrän.

While intended only for fighter combat there has still been found a need for the Skrän to do point-defense work, which neccessitated a crash program to update the fighter's targeting systems. Still, due to the cannon’s low rate of fire Skrän doctrine is to only target missiles if no other targets are available.

Later models of the Skrän have been upgraded with fighter-scale Energized Reactive Field emitters that build up immense potential differences between the craft and its environment. Once charged, the field needs just the slightest suggestion of contact in order to to reach out and equalize the potential - which takes the form of a powerful energy jolt, capable of destroying missiles and seriously harming other fighters and light ships.",,,
prv_ovasen,SHIP,"Advanced companion fighter which harasses the enemy with a clutch of scaled-down Skata missiles. Also carries an extended-range Punktskydd cannon for use against hostile fighters and missiles. 

The hull is protected by a narrow but reliable omni-shield generator and two layers of duranium-hallbar plating. A magazine of additional missiles is located under the cockpit and is accessed continually while the supplies last.

Expensive to replace and manned by a crew of two, operators are strongly encouraged to only deploy their Oväsen wings in close coordination with friendly ships.",,,
prv_diskordant,SHIP,"Strike fighter armed with a pair of Light Spattergun plasma projectors. This mobile craft swoops in and drenches its target in volleys of superheated plasma.

The cockpit, engine and critical machinery are protected by an ablative armor plating that can be replaced in a manner of seconds, something necessitated by the Spatterguns infamous tendency to cover every available surface with burning death.

Early models carried a full-scale Spattergun, but unmanageable levels of splashback damage forced development of a scaled down version. Diskordant pilots passing through the Ryak High Energy Labs are fond of showing off the station museum's fighter prototype to anyone willing to get roped in. It's mostly holes.",,,
prv_missljud,SHIP,"Built to distract and disable enemy point defense and interceptors, the Missljud attacks its target with short-range EMP missiles. The otherwise delicate drone is protected by a reliable omni-shield, allowing it to soak a fair amount of enemy firepower.

This unmanned craft's purpose is to enhance the performance of other fighters by overloading or just outright absorbing hostile firepower. The Blåmes SRM, while lacking a breaching charge, is highly capable of disabling any electronics near the point of impact.",,,
prv_oklang,SHIP,"Fragile attack drone armed with a focusing beam laser in a rotating housing. Opting for offense over defense, they carry a damage-boosting system but only minimal defenses. Oklang are normally operated in large wings as heavy materiel losses are to be expected.

While the drone itself is easy to manufacture, producing LPCs for this fighter has proven difficult, with low yields and a high refuse rate. As such, availability is highly limited and it’s more common to hardwire a bay nanoforge with the pattern - or to simply use a sector-standard model, such as a Wasp or Talon, instead.",,,
prv_skral,SHIP,"Torpedo bomber with a twin-mounted powered launch system similar to that found in the Kaja-family missiles. Skrål strikes are frighteningly swift.

Formally the Plasma Burn system is only supposed to be engaged when the fighter is in final approach for the bombing run, but endemic recklessness among prv fighter pilots and the general stresses of combat mean Skråls tend to burn early and often. When proper procedures are actually followed, a near-instant strike can be executed from, in the words of one Hegemony captain, a ”highly concerning” distance.",,,
prv_jammer,SHIP,"This strike craft launches a velocity-boosted torpedo at its target and then follows the attack up with a blast from a fragmenting particle beam. Deadly against unshielded targets. 

The beam is highly effective against other fighter craft and can also be used to clear the way for a strike, should there be a defensive screen. The Jämmer only carries enough capacitors for two Fräsar-bursts however, potentially leaving it without any follow-up to the torpedo attack.",,,
prv_stillhet,SHIP,"Sophisticated fighter with a phase system and a bevy of light energy weapons. Its durable armor provides it with reliable protection against kinetic attacks.

Piloting the Stillhet is a tremendous experience - Between the wash of the largely unshielded phase coils and the fully g-isolated cockpit that, from the pilot's perspective, lets the entire craft rotate around them, little else compares. These exertions mean that once the crew are back on the carrier and the combat stims wear off, drug-induced calm and focus turns into nausea, which is quickly followed by exhaustion and sudden deep sleep as the brain tries to deal with the intense overstimulation of rapid phase shifting and intense maneuvering in zero-g. prv Stillhet pilots in active service are required to adhere to a strict drug regimen and have their health monitored closely by ship doctors. 

In spite of Stillhet jocks being generally well-respected and compensated, once discharged from service and left to their own devices former crew show a disturbing tendency to turn to drug use and danger-seeking habits. Fewer than half are still alive and living unassisted after a decade.",,,

Replacing the left-hand machinegun with a light mortar and most of the right side of the fighter's hull with a Hammer launch rail the strike potential of the vehicle is undeniably intimidating. Unfortunately the unpredictable and poorly understood modifications have also degraded the performance of the engine. Pather engineers attempt to get around this by mounting a modified exhaust nozzle in post-production, but it only helps so much.

Unlike the final Ljungeld model, this weapon fires a barrage of energy blasts that arc through shields more by sheer energy than through field modulation.

The major limiting factor of the design is that once an energy blast is fired, it is no longer possible - or at least practically feasible - to adjust it in response to changes in the shield structure and it must rely on sheer power to compensate for any misalignments.

This straight-forward - brutal even - approach of the test-bed model proved two things: First of all, it worked. The energy blasts reliably arced past shields, often dealing significant damage to the craft behind them. And second of all, it didn't work. The scale of the weapon was immense, and the performance just could not justify such an investment for a weapon that, in the end, was less damaging than a plasma cannon. As such a less direct approach was tried and eventually succeded - a reactive particle beam, that creates and exploits feedback patterns.",Assault,,

prv_fusion_burster,WEAPON,"An unwieldy beam weapon that can tear a hole through even the thickest armor.

Ruthlessly miniaturized, Ruster engineers had to sacrifice much in order to fit the Fusion Burst Laser into such a small package. The microfocus array and most of the control motors found in common beam weapons have been removed, leaving the weapon hopeless at targeting fighters and awkward against frigates. Achieving maximized armor ablation has also required the beam to be restricted to ultrashort wavelengths, leaving it largely incapable of disrupting shields.

Nonetheless the Fusion Burst Laser, once laid onto a target and fully charged, will melt through hull and armor at a rate several times greater than suggested by its small size.

Enhancing their mining blasters was a natural step, and after some experimentation the Belt Blaster upgrade kit quickly became a regional favorite. 

Though large and bulky, the addional energy feed lines and enhanced focusing arrays allow for not just deadly fire in combat, but operators can also lay in a pre-planned firing solution in order to excavate an entire rock face in moments - without having to wait for dust to settle between shots.

prv_akers_nova,WEAPON,"These long-range cannons fire ionized flechettes which are capable of overloading enemy shields by kinetic impact or disabling systems through EMP bursts. Ideal for disabling shield-reliant targets.

prv Starworks' recent acquisition of the Ryak High-Energy Labs shaped the development of this youngest member of the Akers family. Little of the technology of its relatives remain, abandoning orthodox chemical propellants and rifled barrels in favor of an isolated-plasma rail system that can ionize and launch a shell twice as heavy as that of the Heavy Akers without any loss in velocity, offering improved kinetic performance and a strong EMP effect on hull strikes without having to rely on a fuzed charge. Improved ship sensors integration and a thorough overhaul of the control servomotors have also increased the accuracy of the system, especially during sustained fire.

This excellent performance improvement does however come at a price. The plasma rails and ionization vanes both draw significant amounts of extra power, leading the weapon to suffer in flux efficiency. It is also hell to maintain, requiring daily recalibration of the plasma field sensors and frequent replacement of abraded flux shunts and worn out plasma guide rails. Systems installation and grade 3+ service and repair work should only ever be done by a prv-certified technical team at a fully equipped spaceyard.

The shell’s subspace-tearing charge is a minor marvel, offering deadly effect on exposed targets. Regrettably the charges have a short shelf-life and fairly difficult to produce, leading to shipside forges only managing to keep a limited amount in the magazines. 

Mechanically the gun is otherwise fairly traditional, with a tendency towards oversized and high-spec parts. Powerful but simple components define the weapon’s basic configuration.

The end result is a functional but painfully short-ranged weapon that does exhibit peculiar gravitic properties - though they are generally too unpredictable to be of much practical use.  The saving grace for the project was that the resulting weapon is fairly cheap to produce and operate, while still managing good effect on ship armor.

It still carries a certain respect among the prv though, as it is well capable of shaking up a battlespace, opening up opportunities that can be exploited by fast ships and agile minds. And as one admiral remarked, ”a pulse laser cares little about gravity”.

Greatly feared by persean fighter jocks, fed by stories (and, for that matter, by bootleg combat footage) of pilots being hit by the gravblast and getting ejected from the battlefield in a disabled craft, never to be seen again.

Attempts to adapt the technology to kinetic weapons have proven fruitless, as the Studsare fundamentally works by ”skipping” the shell on the shield surface, making as little impact on the field itself as possible. Doing the same with a kinetic shell would be possible, but leave the shield unharmed, making the entire endeavor pointless.",Assault,,

Derived from the prv Spattergun by Rust Belt engineers, the ingeniously named Spatterflamer emits a stream of flux-conductive liquid that is energized by a plasma particle projector. The result is a supercharged semifluid that sticks to ship hulls and delivers devastating burns. 

The liquid projector is uncomfortably bulky, restricting the weapon to large ships. Even then, the conductor reservoirs are challenging to handle as they must be energized in small batches. 

As they faced pirates armed with the weapon, the prv quickly became curious about its potential, and a limited permit was put out to mount it on corporate warships. 

The first corporate craft carrying the weapon was lost in an attempt to charge the main reservoir, bypassing the cumbersome reloading procedure. The fluid quickly went supercritical and underwent fission, turning the better part of the ship into an impromptu nuclear reactor.

An unfortunate compromise of the design is that the magfield generators have to operate disconnected from the main ship generator, necessitating a short delay to charge the on-board capacitors before the torpedo can be launched.

The intricate and valuable gun component of the Svala warhead is reusable, and a little over half of the field operator's manual covers search, recovery and refurbishment procedures. This has done little to help the system's reputation of being wastefully expensive and over-elaborate. The Ryak High-Energy Labs marketing department have given up on combating this characterization and now sell the weapon under the tagline ”Performance at any cost! - When it's your life that is on the line.” Obviously this has not been terribly persuasive when it comes to landing contracts with the Sindrian Armaments Committee.",Strike,,

Very popular in the belts, syndicate fleets combine these pods with heavy autocannons. Once the target’s shields are pressured a quick series of barrages are fired to destroy their hapless victim.

prv_remission,WEAPON,"Specialized in punishing hyper-technology, the shells launched from this mortar cause energy weapons to discharge their capacitors, gravely disrupting the systems of the targeted ship. In addition a fairly large explosive charge ensures that the offender is properly chastised.

The shells contain a two-stage fuze, first discharging a powerful burst of energy from a primary cell battery. Ideally this burst causes a discharge cascade within the flux system of the affected ship, but often it does little more than singe some power lines. The second stage detonates a primer which triggers a sympathetic detonation in the now-discharged power cell, turning the remaining chemical energy into a an explosive blast.

Originally developed by the Luddic Church to combat automated ships, the Remission fulfills its mission admirably; a discharge cascade can knock out advanced electronics in remarkably short order.",Suppression,,

prv,FACTION,"For the upstarts and opportunists of the prv Starworks megacorporation the post-collapse era has been ripe with opportunity, a time where wealth and power is within reach of anyone brave enough to reach out and grasp it, hold it down, and make it his own. After a series of leveraged buyouts, hostile takeovers, and a few direct invasions, the prv has managed to carve out a fief of its own and is eyeing the post-collapse sector hungrily for any new opportunities for an ”acquisition”.

The Works, an orbital megafactory orbiting a backwards fringe world, form the heart of the corporation's power. There one of only a few still functioning nanoforges in the sector churns out ship after ship, squadron after squadron, fleet after fleet to allow the prv to challenge the sector for supremacy. The major powers are not entirely impressed however - what could a group of fringe-worlders hope to accomplish against the likes of the Hegemony? The prv seem to agree, and have pursued trade alliances with the neighboring powers of the Persean League and Sindrian Diktat. Haughtier voices in the inner sector have gone as far as to describe the relationship as ”tributary”.

Indeed the situation of the prv is not entirely clear-cut. While their industrial capacity is respectable and the corporation's navy grows stronger by the day, they lack military experience and have an unenviable strategic situation with vulnerable supply routes connecting far-flung and isolated assets.",,,

Most of the spacefaring population of the faction live as scavengers, salvagers and miners in the Kratul Rust Belt, where the ship graveyards and asteroid mines can be scoured for a great abundance of rusted-up minerals. But, should a salvage group come up empty-handed Rusters travel well-armed and have been known to take live prey. So to speak.

Recent history has the Alliance butting heads with the prv, with a few convoy raids too many spurning the great corporation into a furious vendetta. Frequent prv patrols comb through the miserable ship graveyards of the Kratul system, trying to figure out which rusted hulks are dead, and which are Rusters that have gone dark - possibly laying up a vicious ambush. This low-intensity war has been ongoing for decades, and shows few signs of ending any time soon.",,,
