This mod list works with this version of the game.

# Starsector Mod List

This is a list of the mods I use when I am [streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/lordhaywire).  Suggestions for mods are always welcome!  Join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/a6KzcJ9mnC)!

This is set up how I have mine set up and it works fine. I am sure most modders don't want someone to compile a mod list/pack and distribute because if someone (me) fucks something up then people go to them asking for help, so I highly recommend setting it up yourself. 

Here is a link to the [unofficial Starsector Discord](https://discord.gg/a8AWVcPCPr) if you are going to set it up yourself.  Below are all the links to the mods so you can grab them.

## Vmparams File

I use the 6 gig vmparams file to fix the RAM issues.  You can find it on the unofficial Starsector Discord or I included it here.  You should put it in your Starsector root directory.

## Mods

A bunch of the mods are currently outdated, so I removed them until they are updated.

I have included all the mod files in this repository.  You can just download them all here, and then dump all of them into your mod folder in your Starsector directory.  You should really set it all up yourself though.
