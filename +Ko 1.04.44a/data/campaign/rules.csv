Although the Hegemony officially disproved they grudgingly honoured the application as a public demonstration of upholding the Domain’s legacy. Though their independence was not without compromise, as technically they still fall under Domain rule, a technicality the Hegemony is keen to remind them of, they have the legal right to govern themselves with regards to industrial and civil rule. Military issues are still a matter of Domain policy and the Hegemony were quick to upgrade Arcadia to a Star Fortress as a means of ‘protecting’ Arcadia. 

At the same time Arcadia was being upgraded the Ko Combine negotiated a “self-defence treaty” with the Persean league as a means of acquiring military assets which they permitted from producing themselves, and which the Hegemony refused to supply. Although problematic, the Hegemony saw an opportunity and began using the Ko Combine as a mediatory in negations with other independent bodies who refused direct contact, and while this has achieved success, a worrying connection has been made between those bodies refusing ‘Hegemony interference’ and those promptly receiving Persean made armaments. HEGINT has been keen to establish a connection between the Ko Combine and the supply of Persean weapons but so far this has been unsuccessful. Should a connection be proven it is well-acknowledged that Arcadia Station is poised to remove any ‘war-profiteers’ from the surface of Arcadia and re-establish Hegemony control of the planet.","0:ngcKoCBegin:Begin Game

NGCSetSkill dummy_skill_ordstore 1","Originally a standard Domain-era industrial manufacturer, with the onset of the Collapse Bhilai Astra has become an eccentric organization with an almost cult-like devotion to its craft, primarily serving the Hegemony. The workers who handle the weapons and ships treat them with an almost religious reverence, meticulously maintaining and caring for them as if they were sacred relics. The higher-ups regard the production process itself as a sacred ritual, and oversee it with an obsessive zeal.
 
While Bhilai Astra primarily supplies the Hegemony and the independent market with its weapons, the company itself remains indifferent to the intentions or allegiances of its customers. This indifference to worldly matters has earned Bhilai Astra the ire of the more righteous and empathetic inhabitants of the sector, most notably the Church of Galactic Redemption, who view the heavy weapons manufacturer as yet another minion of Moloch, actively prolonging and intensifying the sector's many conflicts.
 
By comparison, Bhilai Astra's approach to customers who mishandle their beloved weapons is uncompromising. Lifetime bans on all dealings with the company and its subsidiaries are the norm, often accompanied by a mysterious wave of black-ops mercenaries carrying suspiciously large amounts of Bhilai equipment, apparently tasked with hunting down the offender.",0:ngcKoCBegin:Begin Game,

Their indentured servants little more than slaves held to contracts they can never hope to repay. Found in servitude in all levels of society the lives of an indentured varies greatly but they are an easily replaceable commodity and it is contractual that any servant showing signs of dissent be shipped of to the frozen mines of Nomios, a fate that is often final. The Directorate is also known to trade ‘debt’ with foreign powers as a form of currency and it is commonplace for Hegemony and Diktat officials to have indentured servants attending their personal needs. With the lives of indentured servants being so fickle there is a desperation to escape. While some attempt a stolen shuttle ride through the orbital minefields others seek out the underground where rumors of escape are abound.

Mbaye-Gogol has also found itself a place in the organs trade, officially they source their organs from their indentured, either from those seeking a quick way to repay a portion of their debts or from those who those who fall in the mines still owing. In either case, the donor has agreed in writing. The Supreme Executor of Sindria himself is known to have negotiated a supply contract with Mbaye-Gogol for his most loyal guard and, some claim, himself. It would be foolish to believe he is the only man in the sector who has such an arrangement which lends credits to the theory that he has also arranged for a contingency of cryopods should he and his men need to go in to hiding.","0:ngcMbGBegin:Begin Game

NGCSetSkill dummy_skill_phantomflux 1","Following the Hanan Pacha atrocity and the demilitarization of the Yma system the remnants of Eridani-Utopia were quickly abandoned by their closest ally, Tri-Tachyon. Left with little defense they found themselves the targets of constant pillaging and raiding by pirates and brigands. With their calls for help going unheeded their stockpiles of resources and domain tech quickly evaporated into the holds of outgoing raider parties. Although there has been no official connection the precision with which the raids were conducted were too accurate for common pirates, only Tri-Tachyon operatives are known to be so precise. 

When their stockpiles were depleted the raiding stopped a less structured class of pirate took hold of the system. Eridani-Utopia was scattered and on the verge of collapse, their saving grace came from a former brother of the Path and the so-called pirate-lords under his command who found the world beset by the disenfranchised. Claiming a higher purpose they subjugated the remaining citizens and used the the shell of Eridani-Utopia to re-establish themselves as a legitimate polity. After achieving recognition, with the support of the Church, they have began searching the sector for a holy reliquary of unknown purpose. Their claim is that the the atrocity that occurred on Hanan Pacha was an attempt to cover up its existence and only once they have reclaimed the holy artifact can the final words of Ludd come to pass.",0:ngcMbGBegin:Begin,
