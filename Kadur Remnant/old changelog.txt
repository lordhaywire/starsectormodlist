- enabling/disabling settings after new game should now work much better (probably still not perfect, but...)
CUSTOM BOUNTY MANAGER FEATURE CHANGES
- custom bounty manager now increases bounty credit reward scaling with level (does not tamper with base reward but 500FP carrier fleets should feel a bit more worth engaging hopefully)
- custom bounties will now occasionally spawn with rare flagships not necessarily normally available to their faction and not subject to autofit fuckery
- !!! RARE BOUNTY FLAGSHIPS IS A MOD FRAMEWORK !!!

- communist clouds will now start a hidden deep-hyperspace station to provide a firebase for eventual raids on space fascists, funded by some of the more socialistic major factions and allied with some of the minor ones

- Janissary SRM hit points slightly increased, speed lowered to 400

- these will begin appearing in cycle 208 or after the player starts their first colony
- they can also be prevented from spawning via the simple expedient of decivilizing (or invading, with Nexerelin) all of their colonies plus all the settlements of their parent faction
custom bounty manager now tells you the target's faction, which is much more interesting, rather than the offering faction
- it still says the offering faction in the header

2.2.1 - Jan 10th, 2019
Badger Mk.II added
- and drones to support it
Colossus Mk.XIV upgraded
Handful of Nexerelin starting fleets added to Pirate start menu

2.1.5 - Dec 20th, 2018
fixed the damn thing where immortals had missiles stuck on their noses
D-mods removed from "XIV Battlegroup" and pirate ships and skins (they'll still usually spawn with D-mods due to ship quality, but none are 'mandatory' now)
Tech type colors assigned
Pirate start added
Independent start added
script added to clear some room in starting area so you don't immediately get jumped by 8 Hegemony Dominators in the Kadur start

2.1.4
fixed crash when selecting Kadur start with Ship Pack Mode enabled
fixed issue where Kadur start would leave Galatia in permanent limbo and the player unable to escape should they venture into that cursed realm
tips cleaned up a little

2.1.3
really embarrassing thing fixed where the Kadur didn't actually know their own weapon blueprints (maybe? unless i actually commented that out to test something in between the last release and now and just forgot about it. anyway~)
Collapsed Cargo Holds now incompatible with Converted Cargo Bay (the builtin on the Colossus Mk. III) because that made no sense
role weights (and thus spawn weights) adjusted for some ships -- Henchmen should be much less common now, and a few others were slightly reduced in frequency as well
Ion Scatterer damage halved (to: 5, was: 10), flux/shot raised by 2 (to: 12, was: 10), EMP damage doubled (to: 200, was: 100)

VLRMS reload time increased by 5sec (to: 25, was: 20)

Hammer Pod base sprite changed to base from Harpoon, should be less easily confused with Salamander Pod now (hopefully)
Annihilator Rocket Rack added
Harvester Torpedo Rack added
Jezail Sabot Driver renamed to Jezail Mass Driver (as it's now a chemically assisted coilgun rather than a proper railgun, it wouldn't necessarily use a sabot...)
Jazayer Strike Cannon range and first-shot accuracy increased substantially, flux cost and reload cooldown increased to match
Hammer Carrier drone wing increased to 6 OP (was: 4)
Dervish wings increased to 8 OP, 3 fighters/wing, Interceptor fixed to actually use Dervish volley drivers (half damage, have PD tag) as intended
- Rukh variants adjusted to compensate
Maneuverability increased very slightly across the board for Kadur ships (buffs to acceleration, little or no change to other stats)
Fuel efficiency increased slightly for some Kadur ships (Hyena, Falchion, Rukh and Sphinx)
Armor increased significantly for Ram Jet ships (should be slightly more survivable in AI hands now, god willing)
Flux Overdrive bonus increased to 60 (was: 50), duration increased to 5 seconds (was: 3), cooldown increased to 10 seconds (was: i forget. less)
Dire Wolf wing hardpoints changed to small missiles (were: medium)
- Dire Wolf variants adjusted to compensate
Sirocco now tagged as "CIVILIAN", should flee combat rather than blow itself up
Kadur-allied starting option added, starts you in Mirage with a wolfpack of frigates from the mod including non-Kadur vessels, hostile to the Hegemony and Church and suspicious at best with everyone else, with no Academy stipend (but no debt either)
Also added a Lasher second starting ship option because why not
Removed vanilla ruins condition from Kadur and replaced with a non-explorable dummy ruins condition -- no more free lunch (though Mirage is still a lucrative salvaging destination)
Kadur guerrilla fighters will now build camps to harass enemy settlements in their "grand crusade"
Blueprints tweaked, separated, and tagged no-drop -- you'll have to purchase Kadur BPs from Kadur military markets (placeholder until i can get them set up as quest rewards) or pry them from the cold, dead hands of Kadur guard-paladins in a raid
- this also means that "ship/weapon pack only" mode now properly excludes Kadur ships and weapons (except for the Light Flechette Driver, an export) from the campaign.
!!!Version Checker support added!!!
some other stuff i forgot, probably

2.1.2
Sphinx shipsystem bug fixed

lowered Dolphin combat speed
lowered Dolphin hull integrity dramatically
narrowed forward-facing prow turret arcs slightly (usually from 280 degrees to 220) on most ships

lowered peak CR times for everything except the Jackal (which was already low enough :))

v1.1.6b

increased small/medium railgun and coilgun ranges slightly again
added blinking lights to everything b/c i'm a trendhopper
redid Hyena sprite
replaced Oasis background and cleaned up the system a little
fixed SHI trade convoy integration -- SHI ships should show up in Kadur stations a lot less now (they might still show up sometimes, that is intended)
uhhh i think that was it
new ship system for the Hyena: augmented turret system, increases turret rotation speed to 400% for a few seconds
new ship system for the Buzzard and Behemoth: weapons drive redirect, like an ammo feed accelerator but for everything and four times faster... and it cuts your engines and overloads your ship. Kadur engineering, people.
v1.1.5
lowered railgun ranges by 100
raised ABM damage slightly
lowered ABM, HP especially for larger ABM systems

Hauberk-class destroyers now have considerably less hull and armor strength

Dervish phase fighters now have a longer-range phase teleport, though still not as impressive as Tri-Tachyon ships
Vulture heavily revamped, changes include a new sprite, different weapon mounts (now has 1 small universal and 1 small ballistic), more armor, worse maneuverability, and different variants
wrote slightly longer descriptions for things (drunk, at times ranging from 3:00 am to 5:30... i'm sorry in advance.)
implemented ASP Syndicate integration
made hardpoint sprites for weapons (still not pretty, but look less terrible on hardpoints than they did)
v1.1.4
updated Exerelin fleets for the Kadur Theocracy
implemented Exerelin fleets for the Qamar Insurgency
slightly dimmed cores of bright blue "near stars" in Mirage background image
maybe something else (i forget)
v1.1.3
