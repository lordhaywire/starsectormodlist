vayra_sozzer_bounty,20,spaceCommander,Sozzer,Red,reckless,Red's Raiders,Bedlam,FEMALE,pirates,graphics/portraits/vayra_sozzer.png,"The dread pirate Sozzer Red appears on your comm screen, lounging in her command chair on a dim, smoke-filled bridge. Without looking at the comm console, she languidly raises one blood-crusted glove as if to examine it, and begins to speak.

""You know when Rousseau said it all went wrong? Back in the caveman days, one man looked across the stream and saw another man - and said, that one's stronger than me, taller than me, faster than me. You follow?,"" she lowers the glove and swings around in her chair, uncrossing her legs and leaning forward to look directly into the comm unit. Doing so gives you a clear view of her helmet's faceplate - crudely covered in scrap steel and painted red and white in a rough approximation of a stylized, grinning skull.

""Once that happened, that was the end of everything good. Once man has seen his reflection and found himself lacking, he was set on his own path to defeat. Wanting. That's what gets us all in the end. Funny enough, Garden of Eden gets us the same way - except God's the one who's stronger, taller, faster in that case."" 

She reaches forward and hovers a finger over the comm set as if about to disconnect the call, then seems to think for a second and continues to speak. ""Point is, it'll never be enough for you. You're the one with the monster inside, eating, eating, eating, more, more MORE. Why do you do it?,"" She cocks her head as if expecting an answer, but before you can say anything her finger stabs down and terminates the connection. Your tactical officer pings you with an urgent notification; the Raider fleet is spooling drives to combat power, and targeting systems are beginning to paint your fleet with long-range scanners.",FALSE,kadur_remnant,150000,10,"The Kadur Remnant have posted an open-ended bounty on the dread pirate Sozzer Red, reknowned for her brutal raiding and hijacking of Kadur supply convoys since well before the Hegemony invasion and fall of Kadur and Oasis. While Kadur justiciars have finally managed to track her and her Raiders to their out-system lair, they lack the strength to have any hope of taking the pirates down on their own and therefore must turn to independent contractors. Bringing them proof of her death would be a sure way to increase your standing with the Kadur Remnant, and might net you some nice combat vessels as salvage - she is known to pilot a uniquely modified Sunbird-class destroyer and command a small fleet of stolen Kadur ships as well as more typical pirate craft.",vayra_sunbird_sozzer_red,"vayra_sunbird_fs, vayra_sunbird_fs, vayra_sunbird_fs, vayra_sunbird_fs",80,1.1,100,1,,,TRUE,FALSE,206,5,50

""Well, well, well. Did the Kadur send you to take back their toys? It's a little late, my friend."" He shrugs, and you get the distinct feeling that he's smirking at you from behind his polarized faceplate. ""I guess I shouldn't be surprised that a bunch of religious nutjobs from a backwater system can barely keep track of their own assets.""

Flanked by his bridge crew, golden-masked and impassive, he regards you for a moment then begins to speak: ""Did you ever hear the tragedy of the Harrowing? No? I thought not. It's not a story the Hegemony would tell you. It's the story of the death of a culture. The Kadur Theocracy was an sovereign polity, rich and powerful enough to stand independent from both the Hegemony and the League. Its people lived happy lives under the watchful gaze of the Theocrats, fed by the bountiful farms of Oasis and well-equipped with materiel produced from the mineral riches of Kadur... But the Hegemony saw this as an affront to its power. We had two Caliph-class superdreadnoughts, and could even have stood against a full-scale attack. The only thing we were unprepared for was the deployment of a Planet Killer-class weapon, which eventually, of course, they resorted to. Unfortunately, we fought their grand invasion fleet to a standstill, then they deployed the virus bomb that destroyed our home and killed millions. Ironic, we could protect ourselves, but not our people.""

He sighs heavily. ""But I suppose you have not come here to hear an old man talk, have you? You are not the first Hegemony running-dog to come chasing glory, nor shall you be the last. Fine, come then - let us fight. Perhaps once the wreckage of your fleet drifts slowly across the reaches of this system we shall know peace for a moment.""",FALSE,hegemony,1000000,25,"Reports indicate that the sole surviving Kadur Theocracy Caliph-class superdreadnought, the KHS-001 Hand of God, has been tracked back to a remote system where a flotilla of Theocracy loyalists lurk plotting strikes against Hegemony controlled systems.

Your comms officer patches it through, and you are met by the sight of a woman in traditional Theocrat Remnant attire, flanked by ivory- and brass-masked staff officers. As you watch, she removes and lowers her own mask to let it hang suspended from her collar, obscuring the Kaduran eye emblem painted on her combat armor. Her eyes blaze with a lust for violence, and she eyes you up and down like one would a pest. 

""You affront me with your presence, infidel. What, the mighty Hegemony has finally grown tired of sending their dogs to die? Pity, the last one almost posed a challenge."" She walks closer to the camera, until nothing but her scornful eyes are in your view. ""Perhaps you'll bring something unique to me, you don't look like the type to cling to old-world doctrine.""

""Ah, they always return to the scene of the crime. From the moment you struck me from the stars, I've known and observed every move you've made. Every visit to the market, every bounty you took, every time you've fucking blinked. I've waited for my revenge, and much to my delight you've offered yourself up - not that I expected anything else from you. You spacers are all the same. You wrap yourselves in the flags of some polity or another, clinging to CHILDISH ideals like pragmatism and the rule of law. Its despicable. The very sight of your fleet sickens me, such a chaotic mix of heresies. You'll go across the sector just to chase down a shiny new toy or loud cannon, but you won't exert the effort to even think why you do. Its not in your nature to question such things. Buy, sell, murder, and annihilate. Its all the same to you, you just get paid for it. You only came after me because you knew I had another plaything for you to rip from its owner, just to sit in some forgotten storage dock for a cycle or two.""
