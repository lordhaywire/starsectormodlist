		"FRONT TOWARDS ENEMY",
		"Kadur ships are Low Tech taken to an extreme - poorly shielded, fast in a straight line, sluggish to turn or retreat, and devastatingly well-armed. They excel in straightforward fights and when allowed to choose the terms of their engagements, but falter when surrounded or under sustained pressure.",
		"Kadur ships are designed to override equipment safeties once they have taken significant hull damage, enabling them to launch a final devastating attack or flee at maximum speed.",
		"[Commissioned Crews] Especially devoted Kadur crews modify their ships to enhance the effects of their automatic overdrive, activated once a certain amount of hull damage has been taken.",
