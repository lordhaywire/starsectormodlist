vayra_burkaan,CUSTOM,"Rich in resources but continuously bombarded by heat and gravitational forces by the planet's twin stars, it's a wonder that anyone dares approach Burkaan at all. Nevertheless, some independent miners do call the planet home, residing in utilitarian low-orbit habitats which use the planet's bulk to shield themselves from the worst of the solar radiation.",,"Rich in resources but continuously bombarded by heat and gravitational forces by the planet's twin stars, it's a wonder that anyone dares approach Burkaan at all.

vayra_gehenna_angra_mainyu,CUSTOM,"Caught firmly in the grip of Gehenna and heated powerfully by its gravitational forces as well as friction with its accretion disk, Angra Mainyu is a hot gas giant of only just sub-stellar mass. The constant reactions within its core and atmosphere propel millions of tonnes of ionized gases into space every minute, creating a powerful magnetic field across the entire inner volume of the system.",,"Caught firmly in the grip of Gehenna and heated powerfully by its gravitational forces as well as friction with its accretion disk, Angra Mainyu is a hot gas giant of only just sub-stellar mass.

vayra_gehenna_tortuga,CUSTOM,"Originally anchored around the hulk of a Domain-era seedship whose crew turned buccaneer even before the Collapse, the pirate haven of Tortuga has since grown to an expansive deep-space megacity. Millions of souls seeking an escape from the panopticon of the Hegemony, the megacorps, or their local governments have one way or another made their way here; whether or not the anarchy and lawlessness of Tortuga represents an actual improvement for them is a different question.",,"Originally anchored around the hulk of a Domain-era seedship whose crew turned buccaneer even before the Collapse, the pirate haven of Tortuga has since grown to an expansive deep-space megacity.

vayra_kadur,CUSTOM,"An early beneficiary of Domain terraforming projects, the surface of Kadur was once a habitable, resource-rich desert spotted with lush oases and sapphire seas and inhabited by nearly a hundred million people. Now, however, the planet's atmosphere is stained an ugly yellow-brown - choked with long-lived viral spores immediately lethal to all known forms of life.",,"As you enter orbit around Kadur, automated sentry beacons ping you with incessant messages warning of viral contamination and urging you to reverse course. Thick, wavering tendrils of spores seem to reach towards your ship from the upper atmosphere like the grasping tentacles of some enormous beast, necessitating continual minute adjustments in order to avoid. Despite these inimical conditions, some crazed few still inhabit the fragmented and battle-scarred ruins of the orbital facilities around the planet: Refugees with nowhere else to go, of course, but also pirates, smugglers, and other low-lifes whose need for a place to lay low outweighs their concern for the dangers present.",
vayra_kadur_revenant,CUSTOM,"A katamari of derelict spacecraft, arrayed around the massive burned-out hulk of a Caliph-class dreadnought as a centerpiece and foundation. Scaffolding, rigging, and hastily constructed habitation domes encrust the exterior of every ship that looks to retain even a shred of structural integrity.",,"A katamari of derelict spacecraft, arrayed around the massive burned-out hulk of a Caliph-class dreadnought as a centerpiece and foundation. Scaffolding, rigging, and hastily constructed habitation domes encrust the exterior of every ship that looks to retain even a shred of structural integrity.",
vayra_kadur_toxx,CUSTOM,"A hulking mass of space wreckage, standing out even among the shattered fragments of orbital docks, shipyards, stations and satellites ringing Kadur. Occasionally, a small segment will break off and descend into the toxic yellow-brown soup of the planet's spore-choked atmosphere, trailing flame.",,"As you enter orbit around Kadur, automated sentry beacons ping you with incessant messages warning of viral contamination and urging you to reverse course.

vayra_mirage_star,CUSTOM,"Mirage is a large, bright main sequence star nearing the end of its life. Its deep, warm yellow light has a tendency to wash out detail, especially when filtered through the densely packed Seraphim asteroids which keep its relatively close-orbiting second and third planets within human-survivable temperature ranges.",,"Mirage is a large, bright main sequence star nearing the end of its life. Its deep, warm yellow light has a tendency to wash out detail, especially when filtered through the densely packed Seraphim asteroids which keep its relatively close-orbiting second and third planets within human-survivable temperature ranges.",
vayra_oasis,CUSTOM,"Oasis, the jewel of Mirage, was almost completely terraformed by the time of the Collapse; a rare occurrence in the sector. While uncomfortably hot and humid, the climate is survivable by unprotected humans and the atmosphere is breathable provided one has received the necessary immunizations. Vegetation grows thick and rich across every exposed scrap of land, kept at bay by periodic slash-and-burn campaigns by the populace.",,"Oasis, the jewel of Mirage, was almost completely terraformed by the time of the Collapse; a rare occurrence in the sector.

vayra_requiem,CUSTOM,"A gargantuan, ancient fortification dating back to the earliest Domain colonization efforts in the sector. Habitat pods and jury-rigged expansions form a patchwork over the outer hull, obscuring many of the sensor domes, docking spires, and imposing heavy weapons emplacements it originally bristled with - though more than enough of the latter remain to deter any possible assault.",,"A gargantuan, ancient fortification dating back to the earliest Domain colonization efforts in the sector.

vayra_yakchal,CUSTOM,"Yakchal is an ice giant comprised primarily of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. The planet's surface is compressed by immense gravity and frequently obscured by whirling thunderstorms, which combine to make landing - and returning to orbit - extremely difficult. A corporate ice-mining complex stakes out a meager existence there, established to manufacture starship fuel from abundant water-ice on the surface.",,"Yakchal is an ice giant comprised primarily of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.

kadur_remnant,FACTION,"Born from the unlikely alliance of two traditionally opposed colonies who banded together during the Collapse to seize their independence from the Domain of Man; the cult-colonies of the Kadur Theocracy were once a great power in the Persean Sector with their own native shipbuilding industry and a powerful spaceborne navy. But now the theocrats are no more - murdered along with millions of the Kadur people in a brutal conflict which saw the garden world Oasis, the jewel of the Mirage system, seized by the Hegemony and Kadur itself devastated by a Planet Killer-class virus bomb. Now the Kadur Remnant skulk the fringes of the sector in a captured Domain-era orbital fortress and the derelict wreckage of their once-great fleets, fighting a desperate battle for the continued survival of their religion and their people.

The faith shared by all Kadur people is still deeply ingrained in every part of their culture, but where the Theocracy was inflexible and hierarchical, the Remnant is decentralized and fluid. Their shared beliefs have grown less dogmatic; focused more now on the connection between individuals forged through mutual hardship, and less on the divine right to power claimed in years past by their religious leaders. The Kadur people remain staunchly independent isolationists, regarding other factions with at best a wary suspicion born from centuries of mutual distrust, but have begun to make some diplomatic connections with other political players in the sector who are hostile to the Hegemony.",,,
vayra_bread,PLANET,"Comprised of several different exotic elements, the surface of this dense semigaseous planet churns and roils constantly in a beautiful - and entirely hostile to any sort of terrestrial habitation - display of planetary chemistry.",,"From low orbit, the shimmering clouds of rare elements present on the planet below are even more impressive. You watch in wonder as a massive violet cloudfront sweeps across the surface in an eddy of color, leaving minute whirlwinds of iridescent red, purple, yellow, and green behind it.",
vayra_abid,SHIP,"A rare sight in the sector, the Abid is an atmosphere-capable heavy bomber carrying explosive ""dumb"" bombs designed to evade planetary defense systems through their lack of active guidance. Although much less likely to hit their target when deployed in microgravity environments such as space combat, the maximum damage potential of its bombs makes it an extremely credible threat to large targets such as stations and capital ships.",,,
vayra_archimandrite,SHIP,"The 'hammer' to the Targe's more heavily armored but less mobile 'anvil', the Archimandrite is a versatile combat destroyer equipped with a robust flux core capable of overcharging the vessel's weapons and engines for a short period of time, and thus capable of impressive bursts of speed and firepower. With a potent forward battery making it well-suited for deployment as either an artillery ship or a mobile striker, it is both loved by the Kadur and feared by their enemies.",,,
vayra_arquebusier,SHIP,"The Arquebusier, named for its trademark weapon, carries a miniaturized version of the fearsome Fission Howitzer to deliver punishing anti-armor firepower from extreme range. A deep flux pool supporting a heavy frontal shield emitter and temporarily overclockable autoloader further enhance its fire support capabilities.",,,
vayra_prophet,SHIP,"With the Caliphs fled or fallen, the Prophet-class battleship is now the heaviest vessel deployed by what remains of the Kadur navy; a true spaceborne leviathan, heavily armed and armored, capable of fighting off an Onslaught in close combat or strongpointing a defensive formation against a much larger fleet. 

Lacking a proper orbital shipyard capable of full-scale capital ship construction, each hull must now be patched together manually - one at a time - in an incredibly labor-intensive process utilizing dozens of nanoforges and MPCs each hacked to output a single component. While expensive and laborious, none can deny the effectiveness of the result.",,,
vayra_behemoth,SHIP,"Behemoth-class battlecruisers are armed with a superheavy kinetic projectile accelerator running the entire length of the ship, built to provide long-range fire support. Mounting an experimental main reactor weapons redirect system, they are commonly deployed as system defense vessels by the Kadur navy.",,,
vayra_buzzard,SHIP,"Protected by thick sloped armor, the Buzzard is a tough nut to crack. While notably overgunned for such a small craft, the amount of targeting equipment and other support infrastructure crammed into its frame leaves the actual fitting of weapons a difficult, frustrating, and drawn-out process rife with compromises - a fact often cursed by its maintenance techs and captains alike.",,,
vayra_caliph,SHIP,"The titanic Caliph-class superdreadnought once, as the flagship of the lost Kadur Theocracy naval forces, led gleaming fleets of starships in defence of the Mirage/Truth binary system. Now battle-scarred and damaged but still very much an imposing presence, the terrible might of the Caliph represents the last dying gasp of a once-mighty nation and the last hope of bloody revenge for its bitterly vindictive crew.  Bristling with armament and well-protected behind thick armored belts, the Caliph is viewed by some of those aboard as the clenched fist of their vengeful god, and any who have stood against it would do little to argue that point - if any survivors of such a battle could be found.",,,
vayra_camel,SHIP,"The Camel-class heavy frigate, named after a creature from Old Earth of legendary strength, is one of the largest combat vessels still classifiable as a frigate. Its thick armor and respectable ordnance capacity form the backbone of Kadur combat patrols.",,,
vayra_dervish,SHIP,"The Dervish is an agile light interceptor, equipped with an experimental short-range mass driver firing unstable crystalline shards that fragment explosively on contact with intervening matter as well as a light AAM pod to threaten enemy strike craft. While well-suited to harrying enemy small craft, it falters when faced with more heavily armored or shielded targets.",,,
vayra_dirk,SHIP,"Equipped with a light Jezail kinetic mass driver, the fragile Dirk excels in its role as a long-range support craft. A broad-spectrum defensive flare system provides limited antimissile capabilities.",,,
vayra_djinn,SHIP,Djinn-class vessels begin their service life as Phaeton tankers before being heavily refitted. They sacrifice a little fuel capacity for a heavy missile system.,,,
vayra_dolphin,SHIP,"Little more than a brick of heavy duranium armor bolted to a set of cruiser-grade engines, the Dolphin-class tugship was originally designed to accompany Kadur Theocracy crusade fleets across the sector. While the Theocrats are dead and the Kadur launch no more crusade fleets, the Dolphin still has a niche as a hardened combat tug and provides considerably more survivability than the sector-standard Ox.",,,
vayra_falchion,SHIP,"The Falchion-class destroyer possesses respectable armor plating for its class, and a mid-weight weapons loadout with heavy convergence on the vessel's forward section. While it has excellent speed for a destroyer, inexperienced or reckless captains can easily find themselves deep in enemy territory with their shields overloaded, their reactor redlining, and missiles closing in. All told, the Falchion an effective hunter-killer when deployed against lighter vessels and, when misused, a reliable source of junior officer casualties among what remains of the Kadur fleet.",,,
vayra_ghulam,SHIP,"A Qamar assault craft design, the Ghulam is heavily armored, shielded, and carries a pair of miniaturized rail drivers firing fission-reactive shells optimized for electromagnetic disruption. Relatively slow for a fighter, it is designed to be a persistent and extremely difficult to eliminate threat to enemy warships in close combat.",,,
vayra_golem,SHIP,"A menacing warship, plated with metre-thick sloped armor and brandishing a pair of heavy ballistic batteries - but light on both missile armament and point defense and reliant on escort craft for protection - Golem-class cruisers are the primary system defense craft of the Kadur Holy Fleet. While tough and heavily armed, they have a reputation among Kadur engineers and shiptechs for outright hostility to modification due to a lack of ordnance capacity and mounting space.",,,
vayra_hauberk,SHIP,Hauberk-class Electronic Warfare destroyers boast an impressive array of equipment designed to jam enemy targeting sensors while enhancing those of their allies.,,,
vayra_hegbinger,SHIP,"Originally a lightly armed patrol destroyer, all surviving examples of the Torturer were refitted by the Hegemony with surplus phase coils and experimental attack systems extracted from Tri-Tachyon corporation wrecks after the chaos of the first and second AI wars. Due to mental strain caused by the the poorly-understood mechanics of entrance into p-space, placement aboard these ships is regarded as something of a punishment among Hegemony captains - that said, none can deny their effectiveness.",,,
vayra_phalanx,SHIP,"One of the first indigenous Kaduran fighter designs ever produced, the Phalanx excels at pressuring shields and forcing overloads with its light mass drivers and Jerboa microspike projectors. Lacking any explosive punch of its own, it is typically paired with a bomber or assault fighter to follow up on the openings it creates.",,,
vayra_hoplite,SHIP,"Based on an upscaled Phalanx fighter chassis, the Hoplite trades in its light volley drivers and microspike rails for a pair of Jacana kinetic spike missiles - albeit at a slightly lower density and power than their shipborne counterparts. Enlarged engines allow the craft to maintain a similar thrust-to-mass ratio to its smaller cousin.",,,
vayra_phalanx_m,SHIP,"This Kadur fightercraft's weapons systems have been swapped out for sector-standard light machine guns, and its light spike missiles traded in for a pair of unique kinetic disk launchers utilizing poorly understood mass-anomaly tech to 'rebound' off of targets and return to the fighter. In addition, the hull has been painted in the trademark steel blue and ice white of the Mayasuran Navy; too professional of a conversion to be a battlefield capture, this points to increased cooperation and collaboration between the two nations in their eternal war against the Hegemony.

In addition, the hull has been painted in the trademark steel blue and ice white of the Mayasuran Navy; too professional of a conversion to be a battlefield capture, this points to increased cooperation and collaboration between the two nations in their eternal war against the Hegemony.

Based on an upscaled Phalanx fighter chassis, the Hoplite trades in its light volley drivers and microspike rails for a pair of heavy kinetic missiles. Enlarged engines allow the craft to maintain a similar thrust-to-mass ratio to its smaller cousin, and an omnidirectional shield generator affords it some degree of protection on its way to its target.",,,
vayra_hyena,SHIP,"Fast, fragile, and packing a punch, the Hyena-class frigate is the light picket and scout craft of the Kadur navy. It is commonly deployed as an attack vessel to harry enemy support craft or chase down fleeing freighters, but can also be effective if equipped with support weapons and allowed to skirt the edges of the battlefield.",,,
vayra_immortal,SHIP,"The Immortal pushes the line between strike craft and warship, barely fitting on most flight decks. It boasts light armor-piercing missiles, a variety of anti-small craft weapons, and can fight on equal footing to some light frigates - though its size and armament require long refit times.",,,
vayra_mamluk,SHIP,"An iconoclastic missile carrier design produced by the Qamar Insurgency, the Mamluk combines high speed, long-range weaponry, and simple construction to provide an extremely efficient strike craft for small fleets that may lack the logistical capacity to field heavy bombers and assault fighters.",,,
vayra_martyr,SHIP,"Little more than a zeta-level AI core bolted to a light chemical cannon and set of maneuvering thrusters, the aptly-named Martyr drone provides cheap, easily replacable support for Kadur ships that lack the capacity to outfit a wing of proper strike craft.",,,
vayra_myrmidon,SHIP,"A sturdy and well-armored heavy bomber with a healthy complement of point defense guns, the Myrmidon is designed to resist station-scale point defense networks on its way to deliver its payload - two antimatter-catalyzed heavy nuclear torpedoes. Shrugging off hits that would destroy a frigate and capable of cracking even the heaviest armor in the sector, the Myrmidon poses an existential threat to stations and capital ships alike.",,,
vayra_neferi,SHIP,"Blazing fast and boasting a missile loadout rivaling that of some frigates, the Neferi is designed to enable the interception of hostile bombers and other strike craft at the longest range possible. With low maneuverability at combat speed and minimal firepower once its initial load of missiles is expended, it fares poorly in prolonged engagements.",,,
vayra_rukh,SHIP,"The Rukh is a fast cruiser-carrier that relies on its fighter complement and powerful engines for protection. Equipped with advanced sensor and comms arrays, it is able to share targeting data with its fighter squadrons to give them unparalleled effectiveness in a dogfight with enemy strike craft.

An example of convergent evolution, the Rukh actually bears no relation to the similar-in-appearance Heron fast carrier. Kadur shiptechs were forced to derive the class entirely from an unmodified Eagle-class blueprint, as the Domain colonial security forces were not fielding any carriers during the time of the Collapse when the Kadur seized the Mirage star fortress with its stock of Expansion-era cruiser MPCs.",,,
vayra_seraph,SHIP,"The Seraph-class battlecarrier is purpose-built to act as a force equalizer against hostile carriers and battleships, boasting a pair of powerful heavy mounts and capable of providing excellent anti-fighter support for its strike wings through its experimental Mass-anomaly Field system.",,,
vayra_shirdal,SHIP,"The Shirdal is a destroyer-scale carrier once commonly seen in second-string Kadur Holy Fleet defensive detachments. In the cycles after the Harrowing, it has been reborne as a light strike carrier for itinerant crusade fleets in their Forever War against the Hegemony.",,,
vayra_sirocco,SHIP,"The Sirocco-class supply ship is a fast and heavily armored logistics vessel well-suited to defending itself from pirates and privateers. Derived from a corrupted Falcon-class light cruiser blueprint combined with sector-standard cargo and fuel pod MPCs, it stands as an excellent example of Kadur design ingenuity.",,,
vayra_sphinx,SHIP,"Originally constructed to provide a fire support platform for Kadur system defense fleets, Sphinxes are now the heaviest vessel commonly deployed by the Kadur Remnant. Plated with thick armor belts and mounting heavy forward batteries along with the flux infrastructure to use them, it makes for an imposing presence on the battlefield. Unfortunately, logistical costs in line with its combat effectiveness mean it is deployed less often than its commanders would no doubt prefer.",,,
vayra_golden_eagle,SHIP,"The Golden Eagle is a derivative class of the ubiquitous Eagle-class cruiser, slightly enlarged to afford space for more numerous weapon mounts along with additional engines to offset the added mass. Lacking the shield strength of its predecessor, the Golden Eagle must rely instead on its armor for protection. A fearsome assault ship, well-armed and fast enough to effectively flank heavy targets or pounce on unwary lighter craft who venture too close - though poor maneuverability and rear weapon coverage leaves it vulnerable to being flanked itself.",,,
vayra_targe,SHIP,"The Targe is the premier system defense destroyer of the Kadur Remnant, anchoring combat patrols and other light formations with its heavy armor and forming an anvil against which more mobile fleet elements can smash their enemies. While usually outfitted as an artillery or support ship, some particularly vengeful Kadur commanders have been known to override the safety protocols on their Targes, equipping them with short-ranged assault weapons and strike missiles to turn them into brutal, if somewhat sluggish, close-range combatants.",,,
vayra_targe_phase,SHIP,"This Targe-class heavy destroyer has been extensively rebuilt by the Tri-Tachyon corporation as a prototype phase rig, designed to test the integration of ""clandestinely acquired"" Kadur mass-warping technology. Beyond the obvious installation of a phase coil and adjustment of the weapon mounts to fit Company standard armament, it also carries a vastly improved flux core and upgraded engines.

While usually outfitted as an artillery or support ship, some particularly vengeful Kadur commanders have been known to override the safety protocols on their Targes, equipping them with short-ranged assault weapons and strike missiles to turn them into brutal, if somewhat sluggish, close-range combatants.",,,
vayra_termite,SHIP,"A purpose-built combat drone mounting a light kinetic rail driver and low-capacity shield emitter. The Termite offers a cost-effective solution for pressuring enemy shields, but little staying power.",,,
vayra_veles,SHIP,"A strike/assault bomber loaded with fast-moving, high-energy Jazerant plasma rockets, the Veles is effective when deployed against any target.",,,
vayra_sunbird,SHIP,"An aggressive, offensively focused missile destroyer, capable of serving as a heavy strike craft or long-range artillery ship with equal effectiveness. The core of the ship is centered around a robust - and expensively fabricated - set of full-scale forge vats, capable of being overclocked to replenish the ship's missile ammunition mid-battle. When not in use, the forge vats are hard-coded to produce kinetic-armed drones to be deployed via the rear-facing flight deck, providing the Sunbird with point defense cover and pressuring shielded targets for it to finish off with a well-timed missile strike.",,,
vayra_mendicant,SHIP,"A rare example of a Kadur civilian craft, the Mendicant is a sturdy little multipurpose shuttle/haulercraft built for in-system ferrying and short-hop hyperspace travel. Designed with military-grade thrusters and an extensive flare-based Active Defense System, the spec was once called grim - even paranoid - but in the tumultuous cycles since the Harrowing has come to stand as a symbol of Kadur hardiness and pragmatism, seeing service as a light blockade runner or second-string combat vessel almost as often as it used for its original role.",,,
vayra_ziz,SHIP,"The Ziz-class battlecruiser combines strong armor and a flexible forward-focused weapons package with an experimental flux injector system, allowing it to achieve bursts of increased flux dissipation and cruiser-level mobility at the cost of lowering its shield. A devastating presence on the battlefield when used effectively - to flank enemies and score quick kills on smaller vessels - but prone to destruction if kept under sustained pressure or outflanked.",,,
vayra_pirate_harpoondrone,SHIP,"A nightmarish ""chipbash"" of an obsolete heavy escort fighter with a jury-rigged missile emplacement, this pirate-built drone is capable of sustaining a barrage of Harpoon-class MRMs on its target. Rudimentary AI subroutines rely heavily on the parent vessel for firing solutions and tracking data, preventing the drone from being assigned to escort other vessels.",,,
vayra_augoverdrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Engages experimental slipspace mass-augmentation field to increase hull density and reduce damage taken, and vents excess weapons flux directly through thrust nozzles to increase maneuverability, rate of fire, and flux dissipation. Unfortunately shields must be disabled during this process.",Offensive,"Boosts speed, maneuverability, ballistic rate of fire, flux dissipation, and reduces hull and armor damage taken. Disables shields while active.",
vayra_caliphflares,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches flares that distract the guidance systems of incoming missiles and PD weapons. Any missile hitting a flare will be destroyed.,Defensive,Launches flares to confuse the guidance systems of nearby enemy missiles.,
vayra_caliphjets,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Engages experimental slipspace mass-augmentation field to reduce damage taken, and shunts all core power to thrusters for greatly increased forward speed and maneuverability at the cost of being unable to dissipate flux or fire weapons mounted on the core while the system is active. Requires significant flux to activate.",Movement,"Boosts forwards while increasing maneuverability and reducing damage taken. Requires significant flux to activate, and prevents dissipation and firing while active.",
vayra_fluxoverdrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Vents excess flux directly through thrust nozzles, increasing flux dissipation while greatly improving speed and maneuverability. Unfortunately shields must be disabled during this process.",Offensive,"Boosts speed, maneuverability, and flux dissipation. Disables shields while active.",
vayra_martyrchannel,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Appropriates enemy fighter control channels, increasing the effectiveness of launched fighters in direct proportion to the amount they are outnumbered by in the immediate volume.",Offensive,"Increases speed, maneuverability, and anti-fighter damage of launched fighters in direct proportion to the amount by which they are outnumbered by enemy fighters.",
vayra_massfield,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Engages unstable slipspace mass-transference field, causing chaotic disruptions to the inertia and armor density of fightercraft within a wide radius. Does not affect fightercraft launched by this carrier or carriers equipped with a Guardian IFF Comm Array.",Offensive,"Decreases speed and maneuverability of all fightercraft within a large radius, increases their damage taken, and periodically strikes them with a weak EMP arc. Does not affect fightercraft launched by this carrier or carriers equipped with a Guardian IFF Comm Array.",
vayra_phaseshunt,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Reorients the ship to face its target, and displaces it a very short distance in the direction it's traveling. Stores up to two charges.",Movement,"Reorients the ship to face its target, and displaces it a very short distance in the direction it's traveling. Stores up to two charges.",

Reduces damage taken and disables shields while active.,
vayra_weaponsdrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,Redirects power from the ship's shield emitters and main drives to advanced ballistic autoloader systems. The system can only be used for a short time before the increased mechanical stress of its operation forces it to be deactivated.,Offensive,Provides a brief flux cost reduction and boost to the rate of fire of all ballistic weapons. Disables shields and movement - but not turning - while active.,
vayra_unlimitedmissileworks,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Funnels all of the ship's power into the missile forge vats, hurriedly producing a new round of ordnance. As overclocking the forges in this manner is incredibly power-intensive, the ship is unable to use its shields or weapons while regenerating ammunition, and a considerable amount of flux capacity is also required. After use, the forges must be allowed a lengthy period of time to 'cool off' and have emergency maintenance performed on them before they can be used again.",Offensive,"Reloads the ship's missile weapons. Builds a considerable amount of flux, has a long activation time, and disables weapons and shields while using.",
vayra_aam_med,WEAPON,"A short-range guided missile with a purpose-built antifighter warhead and an excellent propellant/guidance package. Normally launched from small two-shot tubes in strike craft dogfights, this bulky missile pod instead fires sixteen AAMs - devastating incoming enemy strike craft and posing a serious threat to warships with damaged armor, although the dedicated warhead design lacks armor-piercing ability against larger vessels. An integrated forge vat produces ammunition on-demand to keep pace with enemy carrier replacement capacity.",Assault,,
vayra_bomb_bay,WEAPON,"A mid-capacity unguided 'dumb' bomb bay, loaded with high-explosive munitions for general strike duty. Most effective against relatively immobile or tightly massed targets.",Strike,,
vayra_burst_ciws,WEAPON,"A Kadur light rail point defense weapon consisting of three microscale rail driver assemblies on a powerfully motorized turret. Burst capacitors allow an extremely high rate of fire for initial volleys, but sustained fire rate drops dramatically once the capacitors are exhausted. 

As traditional rail driver mag-flechettes were found ineffective against armored threats at this miniaturized scale, Kadur fission weapons instead fire subcritical reactive shells which detonate in a microscale nuclear explosion upon impact - producing excellent damage to hard targets as well as a weak electromagnetic pulse effect. Unfortunately, range has been severely impacted relative to other EM projectile weapons.",Point Defense,,
vayra_canister_gun,WEAPON,"A large-bore cannon firing a tightly packed canister of pre-charged rail driver assemblies, especially effective against large, shielded targets. The canister fires its payload upon reaching a minimal distance from the weapon, filling a large volume of space with high-velocity kinetic penetrator darts. If fired in extremely close quarters, the canister will instead prematurely discharged its stored energy into the target causing significant disrupton to electrical systems.",Assault,,
vayra_shockweb,WEAPON,"A dual-mount large bore cannon firing tightly packed canisters of pre-charged rail driver assemblies, especially effective against large, shielded targets. Canisters fire their payloads upon reaching a minimal distance from the weapon, filling a large volume of space with high-velocity kinetic penetrator darts each carrying a residual capacitive charge which can arc to nearby targets. If fired in extremely close quarters, the canister will instead prematurely discharged its stored energy - causing significant electrical disruption to all hostile craft in the vicinity.",Assault,,
vayra_dervish_gun,WEAPON,"Fires small-caliber kinetic penetrator darts at a high velocity and rate of fire, serving as an effective close-in weapon against shielded - or unarmored - targets while also providing point defense cover.",Assault,,
vayra_dual_ciws_beam,WEAPON,"Twin light rotary rail driver assemblies mounted to a heavy CIWS turret, which allows for significantly increased accuracy and continuous power delivery to the weapons during sustained fire. Due to the minute nature of each individual subscale fission shell, shields are able to easily dissipate flux caused by its continuous stream of micro-impacts despite their general effectiveness against strike craft, missiles, and light armor.",Point Defense,,
vayra_ercannon,WEAPON,"A long-ranged low velocity howitzer, firing heavy fission-reactive shells at a dependable cadence. Projectiles detonate in a sub-kiloton nuclear explosion upon impact, producing excellent damage to hard targets as well as a knock-on EMP effect.",Close Support,,
vayra_frag_scatter,WEAPON,A short-ranged defensive gun firing bursts of unstable charged crystal shards from a high performance cached autoloader system. Crystal projectiles travel only a short distance before detonating violently due to the shock of high-velocity firing - some earlier than others.,Point Defense,,
vayra_hauberk_ciws,WEAPON,"A dual-mount ultralight mass driver, launching inert single-gram flechettes at high accuracy, velocity, and rate of fire. Effective point defense when deployed en masse, but of negligible impact to hardened or shielded targets.",Point Defense,,
vayra_heavy_chemrail,WEAPON,"A heavy dual-mount mass driver firing capital-scale frangible slugs at extreme velocities. Extraordinarily effective against targets with light or no armor, but the sheer size and power of the weapon's rounds render it reasonably deadly to all targets. In addition, the lack of any exotic ammunition types makes for a fairly simple loading mechanism, and allows the emplacement to be mounted with relative ease.",Close Support,,
vayra_heavy_torpedo_fighter,WEAPON,"A simple heavy torpedo, carrying an antimatter-catalyzed fusion explosive within a heavily armored chassis backed by a powerful, if short-legged, engine. Compared to the sector-standard Reaper torpedo, the Jazayer gives up some explosive kill power in exchange for optimization of its knock-on electromagnetic pulse effect. Nonetheless, it is still a deadly threat to even capital- or station-grade heavy armor.",Strike,,
vayra_jaguar_fighter,WEAPON,"Built expressly for long-range interdiction of incoming bombers, the Jaguar heavy interceptor missile is a triumph of engineering. Packing a purpose-built antifighter warhead and powerful engines into a lightweight armored chassis, it poses a deadly threat to enemy strike craft. Unfortunately, the warhead's extremely focused design leaves it almost entirely ineffective against larger vessels.",Suppression,,
vayra_jahannam,WEAPON,"A superheavy chemical cannon firing mass-augmented fission warheads the size of small fightercraft - incredibly destructive to armor on any scale. The weapon does however suffer from poor accuracy and low muzzle velocity, making it significantly less effective against agile targets.",Siege,,
vayra_jamadhar_pod,WEAPON,"A medium-to-long range torpedo intended to deal a killing blow to ships that have been overloaded or disabled by EMP effects. While packing enough propellant for the kill vehicle to reach its target from long range necessitates sacrifices in speed, payload, and chassis armor, the result is still more than capable of taking out many warships - especially when launched en masse. This integrated pod mount carries three torpedoes, and cycles in new ones from an internal magazine containing nine more.",Strike,,
vayra_jamadhar_rack,WEAPON,"A medium-to-long range torpedo intended to deal a killing blow to ships that have been overloaded or disabled by EMP effects. While packing enough propellant for the kill vehicle to reach its target from long range necessitates sacrifices in speed, payload, and chassis armor, the result is still more than capable of taking out many warships - especially when launched en masse. This simple external rack holds three torpedoes.",Strike,,
vayra_jericho_lrg,WEAPON,"Fires a barrage of nine long range missiles at a time, offering unmatched area-saturation and suppressive firepower at extreme ranges. 

The Jericho-class Long Range Missile employed by the Kadur Remnant boasts a sophisticated tracking package, powerful engines, and a combat-rated autoloader allowing for continued operation throughout prolonged engagements. Unfortunately the improved engines leave the missiles with considerably less flight time than the sector-standard Pilum LRM, as well as under half the explosive payload.",Fire Support,,
vayra_jericho_med,WEAPON,"A mid-weight dedicated support weapon firing a barrage of four long-range missiles at a time. 

The Jericho-class Long Range Missile employed by the Kadur Remnant boasts a sophisticated tracking package, powerful engines, and a combat-rated autoloader allowing for continued operation throughout prolonged engagements.

vayra_jericho_sml,WEAPON,"A light missile weapon commonly installed on frigates, combat freighters, or civilian craft to allow them to provide additional long-range pressure from the back lines of an engagement. 

The Jericho-class Long Range Missile employed by the Kadur Remnant boasts a sophisticated tracking package, powerful engines, and a combat-rated autoloader allowing for continued operation throughout prolonged engagements. Unfortunately the improved engines leave the missiles with considerably less flight time than the sector-standard Pilum LRM, as well as under half the explosive payload.",Fire Support,,
vayra_jinn,WEAPON,"An extreme-range armored cruise missile massing more than any commonly-used strike craft in the sector and even some light frigates or corvettes. The plated chassis of the Jinn-class Long Range Torpedo houses enough solid-state antimatter fuel to chase targets indefinitely, as well as a rudimentary lock-on system.",Siege,,
vayra_joachim,WEAPON,"A rare example of directed-energy tech long thought lost to the Kadur, the Joachim leverages mass-manipulation technology to drastically upsize the common Graviton Beam emitter into a heavy weapon capable of easily disabling even capital- and station-grade shields.",Suppression,,
vayra_jordan_lcpkv,WEAPON,"The Jordan-class Light Charged Particle Kill Vehicle is a miniaturized high-energy plasma projector packed into a simple dumbfire launch casing. While the magrail-launched projector assembly is quite slow-moving and fragile, the charged pulses it creates are an effective method of sweeping an area clear of missiles and light strike craft.",Strike,,
vayra_light_chemrail,WEAPON,"A light, general-purpose mass driver, using an initial chemical propellant and second-stage rail armature to fire inert frangible slugs at incredibly high velocities. Simple, robust, and reasonably effective against light or unshielded targets.",Close Support,,
vayra_light_ciws_beam,WEAPON,"A light rotary rail driver assembly mounted to a powerful turret. Unfortunately, the small scale of the weapon leaves power delivery somewhat lacking, limiting it to short bursts of fire. Due to the minute nature of each individual subscale fission shell, shields are able to easily dissipate flux caused by its continuous stream of micro-impacts despite their general effectiveness against strike craft and light armor. While the burst driver is not natively able to target missiles, enterprising captains have been known to slave it to a dedicated onboard ship AI for point defense purposes.",Assault,,
vayra_light_fission_fighter,WEAPON,"A short-ranged chemical cannon with a precision rifled barrel, firing light fission-reactive shells optimized for electromagnetic pulse projection. An effective assault weapon against smaller targets, and valuable as a disabling weapon against any opponent.",Assault,,
vayra_light_flechette,WEAPON,"Fires small-caliber duranium penetrator darts effective against shields and carrying a (very) weak EMP charge. Offers a flux-efficient, long-ranged support weapon with low mounting overhead for second-line vessels.

Unable to construct new Hypervelocity Drivers with their degraded blueprints and manufacturing capability, the Kadur developed a line of low-tech reproductions for use as support weapons. An approximation of the original weapon's complex iron-cobalt core has been brute-forced by imbuing the slug with an unstable magnetic charge, maintaining some of the EMP effect but causing it to diverge significantly from its target over long ranges. This effect is, however, somewhat minimized by this weapon's low charging power.",Close Support,,
vayra_lightspike_pod,WEAPON,"More often seen on fighters, this pod of high-velocity unguided capacitive-kinetic spikes has been packaged for mounting on a full-scale warship. Although short-ranged for a missile weapon and containing a limited ammo supply, the Jerboa can still be useful in a brawl to spike enemy hard flux, overwhelm an already-stressed shield generator, or deliver a quick punch of electromagnetic disruption.",Close Support,,
vayra_martyr_cannon,WEAPON,"By far the simplest weapon employed by the Kadur Remnant, the KM-1 'Martyr' light cannon is a robust design that can be assembled, without the help of a nanoforge, from parts readily available in any machine shop across the Persean Sector. Criticized for its short range, low muzzle velocity, and lackluster stopping power, it is nonetheless still capable of threatening warships... especially when deployed en masse.",Assault,,
vayra_med_chemrail,WEAPON,"A general purpose dual-mount mass driver, using an initial chemical propellant and second-stage rail armature to fire inert frangible slugs at incredibly high velocities. Simple, robust, and reasonably effective against most targets - especially those stripped of heavy armor and shields.",Close Support,,
vayra_microflak,WEAPON,A hull-integrated short-ranged defensive gun firing bursts of unstable charged crystal shards from a high performance cached autoloader system. Crystal projectiles travel only a short distance before detonating violently due to the shock of high-velocity firing - some earlier than others.,Point Defense,,
vayra_multirail,WEAPON,"A mid-range assault weapon designed to inundate targets with a barrage of extreme-velocity charged crystal flechette rounds. Unstable projectiles fragment violently when passing within close proximity of hard matter, sending a devastating storm of spall shearing through crew sections and vital infrastructure of lightly armored targets - performance against heavier plating is somewhat less impressive.",Assault,,
vayra_rocket_gun,WEAPON,"Launches a trio of kinetic-kill rockets by means of a low-powered linear motor. Slow-accelerating rockets are susceptible to point defense at close range despite their lack of fragile detonators or explosive mass, but reach a very high top speed as they gain distance from the launching vessel.",Close Support,,
vayra_rocketpod_fighter,WEAPON,"A light strike pod carrying six Jazerant CP rockets, delivering a tight burst of fire at medium to long range. An effective means of pressuring shields and deadly to light craft, but lacks the punch to crack more heavily armored targets on its own.",Strike,,
vayra_rod_launcher,WEAPON,"A high-powered linear mass driver, fed by gigantic internal capacitor banks. Launches an enormous hardened spike composed of conductive metal alloys, which is imbued with an extremely potent static charge - along with incredible velocity - during the firing process, and causes disabling arcs of ionizing energy to nearby hostile targets as it flies.",Strike,,
vayra_sabot_battery,WEAPON,"A dual-mount of the Jezail flechette driver, doubling its rate of fire. Combined feed devices and targeting mainframes lower required infrastructure and power overhead, allowing the coil armatures to be run at a higher charge level for significantly increased range and impact velocity. 

Unable to construct new Hypervelocity Drivers with their degraded blueprints and manufacturing capability, the Kadur developed a line of low-tech reproductions for use as support weapons. An approximation of the original weapon's complex iron-cobalt core has been brute-forced by imbuing the slug with an unstable magnetic charge, maintaining some of the EMP effect but causing it to diverge significantly from its target over long ranges. This effect is significantly more pronounced on more highly charged slugs, such as those fired by this heavier double battery.",Close Support,,
vayra_sling,WEAPON,"Intercepts incoming projectiles at close range with fragmenting point defense rockets. A self-contained pod design with integrated targeting system allows the weapon to be mounted in standard ballistics hardpoints, and a somewhat overengineered autoloader system provides rapid ordnance replenishment even when fitted with aftermarket expanded magazines.",Point Defense,,
vayra_slowlrm,WEAPON,"An aging missile design, intended to provide extreme-range fire support from Kadur warships and logistics craft with excess ordnance capacity. While the large-framed kill vehicle affords plenty of room for propellant, targeting systems, and explosive payload, the missile's combat thrust suffers noticeably for it - at least until the kill vehicle nears its target and discards the bulky long-range fuel tanks for a closing sprint. The missile then fires a series of unguided submunitions upon final approach, allowing it to bypass some forms of point defense. This emplacement features four launch tubes, fed by an autoloader for continued support in long engagements.",Fire Support,,
vayra_slowlrm_left,WEAPON,"An aging missile design, intended to provide extreme-range fire support from Kadur warships and logistics craft with excess ordnance capacity. While the large-framed kill vehicle affords plenty of room for propellant, targeting systems, and explosive payload, the missile's combat thrust suffers noticeably for it - at least until the kill vehicle nears its target and discards the bulky long-range fuel tanks for a closing sprint.

This emplacement features six launch tubes, fed by an autoloader for continued support in long engagements.",Fire Support,,
vayra_spike_battery,WEAPON,"A two-stage, medium range, partially-guided kinetic spike missile. Commonly employed to pressure capital-grade shields from a distance before a strike, or to overload lighter shield generators that have already been stressed. Lacking an explosive payload, the solid core - once fired - is very resistant to enemy point defense by virtue of both its construction and sheer speed. This large missile battery is capable of nearly continuous fire, though its limited internal magazine means it can only keep up a sustained barrage for so long.",Strike,,
vayra_spike_pod,WEAPON,"A two-stage, medium range, partially-guided kinetic spike missile. Commonly employed to pressure capital-grade shields from a distance before a strike, or to overload lighter shield generators that have already been stressed. Lacking an explosive payload, the solid core - once fired - is very resistant to enemy point defense by virtue of both its construction and sheer speed. This medium pod fires two missiles at a time, cycling in new ammunition from a capacious internal magazine with a fairly quick refire rate.",Strike,,
vayra_spike_torpedo_small,WEAPON,"A superheavy kinetic spike torpedo, delivering a massive punch capable of overwhelming most shield generators in a single hit and very resistant to damage in flight. The missile is covered in ablative plating carrying a significant capacitive charge, which sheds from it as electromagnetically imbued chaff as it takes damage - decoying enemy point defense even as the torpedo closes with its target. Upon striking unshielded armor or hull, the missile becomes a sort of 'lightning rod' for the static charge carried by this chaff, causing electromagnetic arcs from any chaff nearby to further disable its target. This small mount carries a single spike torpedo.",Strike,,
vayra_spike_torpedo_medium,WEAPON,"A superheavy kinetic spike torpedo, delivering a massive punch capable of overwhelming most shield generators in a single hit and very resistant to damage in flight. The missile is covered in ablative plating carrying a significant capacitive charge, which sheds from it as electromagnetically imbued chaff as it takes damage - decoying enemy point defense even as the torpedo closes with its target. Upon striking unshielded armor or hull, the missile becomes a sort of 'lightning rod' for the static charge carried by this chaff, causing electromagnetic arcs from any chaff nearby to further disable its target. This medium launcher carries several torpedoes in an internal magazine.",Strike,,
vayra_splintergun,WEAPON,"Twin-barreled light cannon firing razor-sharp charged crystal shards, which lodge in targets and resonate with others to form powerful secondary explosions. Due to their inherent fragility, crystal projectiles are fired at a relatively low velocity and are very vulnerable to point defense.",Close Support,,
vayra_splintermirv,WEAPON,"A heavy carrier missile, launching a wide spread of razor-sharp charged crystal shards which lodge in targets and resonate with others to form powerful secondary explosions.",Strike,,
vayra_srm_4,WEAPON,"A simple guided missile pod featuring a rapid autoloader system, powerful engines, and advanced tracking capabilites, although individual explosive-tipped warheads deal only light damage and are susceptible to point defense. ",Assault,,
vayra_strikecannon,WEAPON,"A short-ranged double barrel mass driver, launching a heavy fission-reactive warhead which detonates in a sub-kiloton nuclear explosion to produce excellent damage against hard targets as well as a knock-on EMP effect. While both chambered shells can be fired in quick succession upon initial engagement, the weapon's aging autoloader design restricts it to a much slower sustained firing rhythm.",Strike,,
vayra_superheavy_driver,WEAPON,"Derived from the massive spinal cannon of the lost Behemoth-class battlecruiser MPC, the depleted infernium slugs fired by the Jannah siege driver are forged in microgravity orbital environments and equal the size of some strike craft. While its potential destructive energy is immense, the capacitor recharge and physical reload time of the weapon are severely restricting.",Artillery,,
vayra_vlrms_large,WEAPON,"An aging, large-framed missile design which affords plenty of room for propellant, targeting systems, and explosive payload at the cost of combat thrust - at least until it nears its target and discards its bulky long-range tanks for a closing sprint.

vayra_vsrm_fighter,WEAPON,"A short-range guided missile with a light fragmentation warhead and an excellent propellant/guidance package, employed by Kadur fighter pilots to decoy point defenses of warships or deliver the killing blow in a dogfight. An integrated autoloader system keeps fighters in the field without requiring refit.",Assault,,
vayra_microimpulsor,WEAPON,"A short-ranged beam cannon with an integrated point defense targeting system, blasting apart incoming missiles and enemy fightercraft with an oscillating pulse of directed force. The beam is sufficient to overpower the thrusters of light vessels, stopping them in place or causing them to spin out of control.",Assault,,
vayra_ioncycler,WEAPON,"A miniaturized blaster weapon, firing pulses of ionized plasma that wreak havoc on lightly armored vessels and electrical systems alike. A powerful bank of capacitors allows it to sustain an extremely high fire rate, at least for short periods of time.",Assault,,
vayra_antimatterpulse,WEAPON,"A fiendishly complicated electromagnetic assault cannon, firing accelerated positron bundles from internally powered mag-containment shells. The positron bundles are quickly annihilated by contact with aether, giving the projectiles a short effective range and a bright 'trail' as they fly.",Assault,,
vayra_hammer_barrage_forever,WEAPON,"This dumb-fire rocket was ubiquitous in the Sector pre-Collapse due to civilian applications discovered by asteroid miners. The go-to strike weapon of the desperately under-equipped, the Hammer is most often employed by poor independent militias, Pirates, and especially the Luddic Path. This has led to the mildly blasphemous alternative name for the weapon, ""Ludd's Hammer"".

The Hammer Fusillade mount provides a stirring example of the expediency of quantity, and is connected to a weapons-grade autoforge for sustained fire.",All-Purpose,,
