# ships,,,,,
roider_drone_breaker,SHIP,"In the old days just a Blasting Laser on a basic drone chassis, the Rockpipers upgraded the Breaker into a hybrid combat/mining drone, equally adept at blasting rocks and ships.",,,
roider_hopskip2,SHIP,"A modified version of the notorious Hopskip shuttle, the Mk.II’s high speed and long range payload can make it difficult to intercept.",,,
roider_bolt,SHIP,"Composed of a cockpit and missile pod crammed between several engines, the Bolt reaches its target with lightning speed.",,,
roider_rocksaw,SHIP,"The thrilling firepower of the Rocksaw requires pilots be pried from the controls. Its chaingun, though mighty, can not fire continuously.",,,
roider_dragline,SHIP,"Inspired by the Xyphos and resembling an air-gunship, the Dragline is big and tough. Its turrets protect nearby ships from missiles while its own rockets rain upon the unwary.",,,
roider_duster,SHIP,"The Duster's turret and bombs, the latter stolen from Wasp blueprints, let it sweep aside fighter screens and missile barrages.",,,
roider_drone_tracker,SHIP,"Cheap, swarming PD drones with a weak, but high dissipation shield.",,,
roider_armature_left,SHIP,"Only the strongest PD grids can stop this tough and quick drone. Reports of its AI achieving ""uncanny"" torpedo hit rates hasn't prompted an official investigation. Yet.",,,
roider_armature,SHIP,"Only the strongest PD grids can stop these tough and quick drones. Reports of their AI achieving ""uncanny"" torpedo hit rates hasn't prompted an official investigation. Yet.",,,
,,,,,
roider_cyclops,SHIP,"The most common combat frigate of the Roider Union, the Cyclops-class's 360 degree turret coverage and all around good profile make it an excellent escort and skirmisher despite its flimsy hull.

Hacked together by the Korovin shipbreakers, mainly from Hermes-class shuttles, the Cyclops has proved its worth many times over. The design was overhauled and standardized by the Rockpiper Engineering Society just in time for the Kiska Incident.",,,
roider_pepperbox,SHIP,"Without the demands of a modular weapon system, fitting a Devastator Cannon instead, this Roider redesign of the Mudskipper Mk.II is a reliable PD boat. It even has a shield.",,,
roider_nolasher,SHIP,"Known for its unorthodox loadouts, the Nolasher-class frigate is cheap and flexible.

Derived from the Wayfarer-class combat freighter, the Rockpipers removed the cargo bay and improved the layout to make the Nolasher an efficient fighting ship.",,,
roider_roach,SHIP,"Heavily armed but reliant on MIDAS armor and its temporal shell for protection, all bets are off when a Roach-class heavy frigate is deployed in the hands of a skilled pilot.

Extremely advanced compared to other Roider technology, the Roach was made possible when the Roiders stole blueprints and other important data for the Scarab-class heavy frigate during the Kiska Incident. TriTachyon was not pleased, but had to console themselves with their loss after the showdown at Three Sisters Station.",,,
roider_sheriff,SHIP,"An extremely advanced gunship/drone carrier, rumors abound as to the Sheriff-class frigate's true origins. A partially corrupted blueprint recovered from a pre-Collapse station? A stolen TriTachyon black project? Aliens? One thing is for sure, its uncanny hive-like interior was not designed with humans in mind.",,,
,,,,,
roider_onager,SHIP,"The Onager-class destroyer is often found in the thick of the fighting, teaming up with its fighters to gun down adversaries.

Hastily converted from Mule-class combat freighters by the Korovin shipbreakers, early Onagers were plagued with problems. Nevertheless, they were essential in protecting the newly formed Roider Union. The design's defects were fixed and its mining utility improved by the Rockpipers.",,,
roider_firestorm,SHIP,"Bristling with turrets and shielded by broadside MIDAS armor, the Firestorm-class gunship incinerates smaller craft. The gun batteries leave little room for other modifications.

Development of a point defense destroyer based on the Tarsus-class freighter began during the Rockpipers' fighter superiority initiative. The Kiska Incident and ensuing conflict with TriTachyon prompted its completion and quick deployment.",,,
roider_bombard,SHIP,"Designed to provide long-range support with its large ballistic hardpoint, the Bombard-class destroyer features a cruiser-grade targeting core.

The Bombard is built around and integrates a Salvage Rig into its frame, making it only slightly less fragile than one might expect. It first saw combat during the Kiska Incident where it fought with distinction; its barrages draining TriTachyon shields and battering their flimsy hulls.",,,
roider_aurochs,SHIP,"Surprisingly well-armored, the Aurochs-class destroyer wields an EMP emitter with which to fry its enemies.

One of the Roider Union's acquisitions during the Kiska Incident was the design for the EMP emitter famously seen on certain high-end frigates. Unable to power it in such a small hull, the Rockpipers settled on the humble Buffalo-class freighter.",,,
roider_cowboy,SHIP,"With its array of ballistic turrets the Cowboy-class carrier can ride herd on its drones and fighters or send them from afar to trample.

A number of factors led the newly formed Rockpiper Engineering Society to focus on fighter superiority for the Roider Union. There were not enough existing carriers, however, so the Nebula-class transport, little used by roiders, was selected for conversion. The crew decks were stripped and shuttle bay exposed to make room for a large hangar. The sides were cut open and fitted with drone bays, while an unusual bridge was constructed to fit extensive targeting equipment for the fighters. The end result is equally adept at striking and assault.",,,
roider_jane,SHIP,"The Jane-class tanker is named after a roider folk hero very similar to the ancient Robin Hood: stealing from megacorps, giving to the poor, and having legendary skill with a rifle.

Deploying a tanker into combat is usually considered suicidal, but the Jane has proven capable of handling itself; unlike the Dram and Phaeton it is based on.",,,
,,,,,
roider_gambit,SHIP,"Though not very nimble, the heavy armor of the Gambit-class allows it to hold its own against full-sized cruisers. Many commanders prize having one as their flagship.

Early Gambits were known to literally come apart at the seams, as they were built from chopped up Venture-class cruisers. Their firepower was considered worth the cost, however, and the Korovin shipbreakers worked with other corporations to build them. These cooperation agreements led to the founding of the Rockpiper Engineering Society.",,,
roider_gambit_p,SHIP,"Though not very nimble, the heavy armor of the Gambit-class allows it to hold its own against full-sized cruisers. This ship has been heavily modified - and poorly maintained - by its pirate crew.

These cooperation agreements led to the founding of the Rockpiper Engineering Society.",,,
roider_colossus2,SHIP,"This is a Colossus hull modified by the Roider Union into an auxiliary strike-cruiser based on Luddic Path designs. The cargo decks are collapsed and re-welded to greatly thicken the ship’s effective armor while additional turrets have been planted along the hull. At the bow, a large weapon mount capable of launching spreads of Hammer-class torpedoes has been permanently affixed. A damper field, whether stripped from some derelict Mora or built specifically for this ship, holds the whole mess together when under fire.

The Colossus heavy freighter formed the core of Domain frontier supply fleets before it was outmatched by the brutal economic efficiency of the Atlas superfreighter. Thicker than strictly necessary hull plating provides protection against cosmic hazards both natural and human.",,,
roider_ranch,SHIP,"Exemplar of the Roider Union's fighter superiority doctrine, the Ranch-class carrier unleashes a seemingly endless stampede of drones and fighters upon the battlefield, but relies on escorts to protect itself from direct assault.

The Ranch's drone bays and long flight decks are carved from the hull of a Starliner-class transport. Once cleared, the former passenger compartments allow an unusually large amount of hangar space, though bulkheads restrict its efficiency. The hull was used as a testbed for formalizing the Massive Impact Deflection/Ablation System, particularly the ablative armor components.",,,
roider_wrecker,SHIP,"A heavily armored war tug, skirmishers beware the Wrecker-class cruiser! It pulls ships in with its mysterious Phasenet system and smashes them on its guns and shock-absorbing armor module.

Built on the ruins of an Eagle or Falcon cruiser, some consider the Wrecker's design reminiscent of a hawk about to leap into flight. It is a recent but popular design integrating component designs found by tech-mining expeditions. Especially beloved by junkyard dogs for both creating derelicts and neatly arranging them.",,,
roider_wrecker_p,SHIP,"A heavily armored war tug, skirmishers beware the Wrecker-class cruiser! It pulls ships in with its mysterious Phasenet system and smashes them on its guns and shock-absorbing armor module. This ship has been heavily modified - and poorly maintained - by its pirate crew.

,,,,,
roider_telamon,SHIP,"The Telamon-class battleship is proof of the Roider Union's industrial maturity. It has an unconventional broadside design, supplemented by fighters and armor modules, which makes it very effective against swarms of small ships.

Only recently developed by the Rockpipers, an Atlas-class superfreighter serves as an anchor for the battleship's frame and is incorporated into the final structure. Many subsystems are made using blueprints stolen from TriTachyon.",,,
roider_argos,SHIP,"A mobile dock, the Argos-class mothership is equipped with the right tools to convert freighters and shuttles into functioning warships, if you know what you're doing. It also has giant cargo holds, plenty of crew quarters, thick armor, heavy missile armament, and, courtesy of being a converted Prometheus, generous fuel storage.

It is unclear when the Argos design was first introduced. The earliest reports are from independent salvors in the fringe, where Argosi were spotted serving as hubs for tech-mining expeditions. More recently a few have been sighted in the hands of ill-reputed roiders, along with a distinct uptick in merchant insurance claims.",,,

# ship systems,,,,,
roider_phasenet,SHIP_SYSTEM,Pulls a target towards the front of the Wrecker. High mass and speed resist the effect.,,,
roider_dreadLoaders,SHIP_SYSTEM,Engages negentropic devices that increase ballistic weapons' rate of fire while applying an entropic aura to their projectiles. Entropic buildup must be dissipated before the loaders disintegrate.,,,
,,,,,
# weapons,,,,,
roider_blastinglaser,WEAPON,"Intended for mining, this weapon is often used in an assault or point defense role.

When asteroid miners need more power than a standard laser and more precision than a blaster, they use the Blasting Laser. Its mining efficiency and common mount type is what enabled roider culture to form in the first place.",,,
roider_zap,WEAPON,Carries an EMP charge capable of disabling most fighter engines in a few hits.,,,
roider_hazard_mrm,WEAPON,"Cheap, small, and less-than-safe to handle, this guided missile rack is made by and for the desperately under-equipped. Fires all four missiles in rapid succession.",,,
roider_marksman,WEAPON,"Though the Sharpshooter's mediocre rate of fire limits its utility against fighters, its long range, perfect accuracy, and high damage per shot eliminates missiles with great precision.",,,
roider_spike_driver,WEAPON,"A powerful, short range kinetic cannon that overwhelms weak shield generators in just a few hits.",,,
roider_pile_driver,WEAPON,"An enormous cannon that pummels its targets with huge kinetic rounds. Its range, however, is limited and its efficiency questionable.",,,
roider_rotary_hammer,WEAPON,"This launcher's unusual rotating loader mechanism is significantly faster than standard systems and can be fed by hand if the magazine is disconnected. Some speculate it was intended to load two torpedoes at once, instead of the warhead and propulsion separately.",,,
,,,,,
# fighter-only weapons,,,,,
roider_marksman_mini,WEAPON,"Though the Sharpshooter's mediocre rate of fire limits its utility against fighters, its long range, perfect accuracy, and high damage per shot eliminates missiles with great precision. This version is miniaturized for use on fighters.",,,
roider_hazard_mrm_bomber,WEAPON,"Cheap, small, and less-than-safe to handle, this guided missile rack is made by and for the desperately under-equipped. Fires all four missiles in rapid succession.",,,
roider_zap_fighter,WEAPON,Carries an EMP charge capable of disabling most fighter engines in a few hits.,,,
roider_vulcan,WEAPON,"A rapid fire weapon that is especially devastating to missiles and fighters at point-blank range. Accuracy degrades sharply during prolonged bursts. 

An advanced timing mechanism beats in the heart of this multi-barrel weapon platform, generally manufactured only by licensed Hegemony Autofactories. Rounds typically use depleted uranium tips and are non explosive. Multiple barrels enable an extremely high rate of fire, which comes at a cost in flux.",,,
roider_mini_vulcan,WEAPON,A rapid fire weapon that is especially devastating to missiles and fighters at point-blank range. This version is miniaturized for fighters and fires in short bursts.,,,
roider_chaingun,WEAPON,"The GA-X Industries Mk. II chaingun excels at close-range fighting, where accuracy is less important than overall damage and volume of fire. This version can not fire continuously.

A 'melee' captain's favorite tool, the Assault Chaingun delivers high-explosive shaped charge rounds on target at nearly 400 shells per minute. Features electrically driven feed and ejector systems and an advanced nano cooling unit built right into the barrel. 

The only drawback is a heavier turret profile which, coupled with the lack of the accompanying governor blueprint, is typically mounted on incompatible rotators giving rise to unexpectedly low turret rotation speeds.",,,
roider_annihilatorpod,WEAPON,"Fires pairs of unguided rockets. Useful for dealing with enemy armor, or - due to having no flux cost - applying sustained pressure.

Features the same medium to long-range rockets found on smaller launchers. Rockets are unguided, with the extra space being taken up by a larger warhead and improved propulsion systems, as well as thicker armor. 

Performs well against larger targets due to the higher chance of striking with multiple rockets. A rocket attack is often used as a screen before a torpedo strike to reduce the effectiveness of Point Defense systems. ",,,
roider_hammer_armature,WEAPON,"This dumb-fire rocket was ubiquitous in the Sector pre-Collapse due to civilian applications discovered by asteroid miners. The go-to strike weapon of the desperately under-equipped, the Hammer is most often employed by poor independent militias, Pirates, and especially the Luddic Path. This has led to the mildly blasphemous alternative name for the weapon, ""Ludd's Hammer"".",,,
,,,,,
# stuff,,,,,
roider,FACTION,"An alliance made up of fiercely independent roiders (roaming asteroid miners) and modest corporations, it's a small wonder the Roider Union formed at all. The expertise of the Korovin shipbreakers and the innovations of the Rockpiper Engineering Society have since produced a formidable arsenal of conversions, retrofits, and entirely new materiel.
Conversion and retrofitting services are offered at Union HQs, but the more difficult retrofits are only offered to Union members.",,,

# Ounalashka System,,,,,
roider_amaknak_desc,CUSTOM,"Habitable in the days of the Domain, Amaknak was devestated by the Collapse. The ruins have been frequently used as target practice and their vaporized remains choke the air with a perpetual haze.",,Only a few lonely mine beacons broadcast from this ruined world.,
roider_dutchHarbor_desc,CUSTOM,"Once a grand station, Dutch Harbor has declined over centuries of on-again off-again occupation. It is currently experiencing something of a renaissance as, though nominally an independent station, the Roider Union has invested in substantial renovations. The Amaknak Orbital Opera House in particular, recently reopened in roider hands, has found unexpected success performing local productions.",,,
roider_maggies_desc,CUSTOM,"The home of Mad-Eye Maggie, this station has seen better days. It is a wretched hive of scum and villainy, where unscrupulous roiders go to blow off steam.",,,
,,,,,
# Atka System,,,,,
roider_unalaskaI_desc,CUSTOM,"Anomalously close to its parent star, Akutan probably formed in the outer system and later migrated inward due to a chance encounter with some rogue cosmic mass. Primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gasses, the temperature and pressure at the core are extreme. ",,,
roider_korovin_desc,CUSTOM,"An illicit dumping ground for centuries, Korovin is a derelict graveyard. Ruined ships lie buried in ash, smashed upon the mountains, and submerged in rivers of lava.",,"A few shuttles yet flit beneath Korovin's sulfurous clouds, gathering valuables from the various salvage sites. Old crawlers creep across the ash plains and cluster around derelicts being broken apart. The monotony is regularly broken by the thunder of a new hulk crashing down.",
roider_rockpiperPerch_desc,CUSTOM,Home of the Rockpiper Engineering Society and capital of the Roider Union. A steady stream of derelict ships from all over the Sector are sent to the shipyards to be scrapped or retrofitted into new warships.,,,
roider_coldRock_bastion_desc,CUSTOM,"A monument to the decline of civilization, Cold Rock Bastion looms in the darkness. While most of the station is in disrepair, the weapon platforms and citadels are distressingly functional.",,,
,,,,,

# Attu System,,,,,
roider_attuStation_desc,CUSTOM,"Battered and beaten by asteroid strikes, Holtz Refining Complex is a notable metal supplier for the Hegemony. Roiders from all the surrounding systems come here to sell their hauls and catch some R&R.",,,
,,,,,
# Kiska System,,,,,
roider_druzhininsAnchorage_desc,CUSTOM,"Named after a local miner hero, Druzhinin’s Anchorage was liberated from pirates by the Roider Union. Rings of habitats and long, arching space docks give the station an anchor-like shape. A number of relatively new citadels and weapon platforms reflect the state of affairs.",,,
roider_threeSisters_desc,CUSTOM,"Run by a coalition of independent trading companies, Three Sisters Station is a hot-spot for smuggling salvaged technology to corporate buyers.",,,
roider_zinStation_desc,CUSTOM,"A formerly-secret research station, the Zin Prototype Shipyard was discovered by the Roider Union and raided in the Kiska Incident. Experimental technology is still tested here, but now with a much heavier garrison.",,,
