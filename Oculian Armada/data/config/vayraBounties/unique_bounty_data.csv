Fine. You will be paid either way.

In blood.",FALSE,tritachyon,500000,10,"It has come to our attention that a certain Oculian officer is needed to be taken care of.

An eccentric of sorts, an Oculian Mikanate who has been rumored to have willingly severed her connection to the Arc Mother in pursuit of her personal goals. With her, her crew and a Pandora that has underwent heavy modifications before her leave as an indepedent.

Just as the time this bounty has been posted, this admiral underwent a fit of rage after the major losses of the other Oculian entities who were also previous bounties of our interests. Now she is struggling to search her way home to Adalie in an attempt to undo her mistake and reconnect.

We want you to find Sheielle and kill her.",ocua_elizabeth_Aggrivated,,350,1.3,1,,FALSE,FALSE,207,20,280
