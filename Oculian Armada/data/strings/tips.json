    "[Oculian] ships are fast and love to kite their slower, less agile victims. However, their poor armor and flux capacity leaves them very vulnerable to Kinetic and Fragmentation damage.",
    "[Oculian] ships have the lightest weight value of all High-Tech style ships, benefitting its very low costs and good movement speed at the expense of underwhelming combat capacity.",
    "[Oculian] ships that bear the Oculus hull allows them to equip exclusive Oculian Core hullmods that greatly change how the ships can fight and the way they are handled logistically and strategically.",
    "[Oculian] Mikanate vessels have greater combat weight and are allowed to use 2 Oculian cores that merge into powerful core hybrids but comes at a higher budget that harms their already low economic capacity.",
    "[Oculian] The Gretly frigate is more than meets the eye. Very rugged and can either become a cost-effective piloted bomb or a reliable kiter that leaves even the most overly tuned frigates in disarray. But can be destroyed by a single, stray harpoon.",
    "[Oculian] The Chemical Core eases Energy weapon costs and increases their damage, but be wary of its recovery costs.",
    "[Oculian] The Crystalline Core is meant for defensive play, increasing weapon range and shield strength at the loss of some speed.",
    "[Oculian] The Pulse Core is a modified Safety Override tailored for Oculian ships that also increases firing speed to all their typical weapons.",
    "[Oculian] The Quantix Core trades Peak duration and Zero-Flux speed for a significant improvement to the ship's fighter replacement capability and an additional hangar for non-Frigates/non-modules. Providing fighter support to otherwise defenseless ships.",
    "[Oculian] The Vapor Core narrows Oculian ships' boasting efficiency to a much greater degree, allowing much longer and stealthier travels at the cost of combat effectiveness. It's also used exclusively outside Logistics hullmods.",
