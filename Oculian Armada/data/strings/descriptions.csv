ocua_pirouette,WEAPON,"The smallest Laser-Canister weapon of its kind, the Pirouette is for those who require constant stream of projectiles with little footprint for firing reserves.

While nowhere near the damage potential of the Prima, the Piroutte is made due to its purpose of being an autocannon replacement for the Oculians as their resources for ballistics are used elsewhere, other than bullets.",Close Support,,
ocua_glint,WEAPON,"The basic weapon of every Oculian vessel, the Glint boasts great efficiency and accuracy through its miniscule damage output.

Not particularly a fond weapon to use, especially when there are more capable weapons that can clear out military devices that were hardened for many cycles, a foreign weapon from a particularly old but familiar age. Where it stands, though, it manages to compete with various point-defense equipment due to its precise capability of disarming missiles mid-flight with its ancient, but high-end emissions of light.",Point Defense,,
ocua_shiredain,WEAPON,"This alternative refit of the Antimatter blaster is made with impressive efficiency in mind, unloading less energy with more output in reserve. The Shiredain, as what the armada called, is adept at generating firing solutions in their compliment.

The Shiredain takes complexity off the original Antimatter blaster by trading in low energy costs and high ammunition capacity against the original's significant burst output. This integration is well-suited to Oculian crafts that produce less energy than that of traditional ships in the Sector; coupled by their high mobility, the Shiredain, when fired in groups, can be used to harass even the most prepared ships.

Very effective against any target.",Strike,,

Introduced by the Oculian Armada as their maintaining a foothold on Haelim along with the pirates assisting them against growing Tri-Tachyon advance, since none of the earlier energy devices were powerful enough to meet the military response.",Close Support,,
ocua_kea,WEAPON,"Composed of an intentionally fractured lens and a powerful battery charge, this weapon can generate a flash pulse so potent that it punches anything within the general direction of the barrel.

Also known as Flash cannons, as the name is scribed in the vein of flashlights, weapons like it would not be possible without breaking or, if not, recreate the laws of Physics through brutish computational power of the Oculian Armada. The Kea was one of the known earliest iterations of such technology, using a small ion core, radiating highly within a confines small tubular crystal. The energy is then expanded through the forementioned lens in a short, wild burst with such intensity that the lasers emitted could collide to solid objects with actual force.",Anti-Fighter,,
ocua_mi_frappe,WEAPON,"The advanced refinement of the Laser-Canister technology of the armada, this weapon has a very demanding calculation input but with a destructive return.

The first of its kind for the so-called Mikanate protocol the Oculian Armada had set up in the 200th Cycle, the Frappe is a powerhouse of a weapon that truly defy the laws of physics by having a greater damage output from a much smaller battery reserve.

While a powerful computer is still needed to calculate the ""perfect"" formula to generate the energy pulses, the laser weapon is easily accepted into any Oculian vessel that can compute the blockchain.",Close Support,,
ocua_shena,WEAPON,"An unconventional use of crystals as of means to disable electronic devices from afar. This basic projection battery is honed for its reliable discharge that would render ion weapons of its size redundant.

Speculations of an advanced quartz battery discharge were proven the moment weapons like the Shena classification were put to service by the Oculian armada. While not particularly as potent as true ion-based weaponry, the contents of its quartz crystals have achieved something very surreal about its otherwise unusuable properties in the heat of battle. Concentrated piezoelectric charges help contain the electromagnetic charge long enough to make through what would easily disperse an ionic pulse and even maintain its high frequency before meeting the target for the electromagnetic pulse.

A stuff that is very unreal to understand but from a maniacal AI that is capable of harnessing such a resource.",,,

To simply put, this weapon has been modified to charge excessive power; an additional capacitor that is accompanied by the Prima's basic components at a more advanced, minituarized scale. Such new minituarization technology of Oculian electronics became more rampant when Adalie's research facility shown a greater heat signature as time passes.

Fit for more modern Oculian vessels that are still rarely seen in the current state of the sector. Though it is possible these may eventually become common. Especially when rumors about Tri-Tachyon suspected to develop new weapons or henious plots behind the scenes.",Close Support,,
ocua_pixie,WEAPON,"Easily described as the vagrant's plasma cannon, the Pixie is hailed as the most available method of unloading high-intensity masses with smallest amount of energy possible.

A laughable efficiency design that initially puts off to experienced gunners on its introduction. Its unaccounted rise in the Oculian arsenal made the aforementioned gunners into a fray. The Pixie plasma cannon is prized by most pirates whoever can install a moderate energy setup, as it does not overload power systems where the traditional Plasma cannon would have.",Assault,,
ocua_blita,WEAPON,"A rapid hardlight cannon designed specifically to hunt down small targets with its extremely light but armor-piercing luminous projectiles.

Not precisely a laser, but mystery surrounds it to an ionized bolt of solidified photons so dense that it breaks the atomic bonds of physical objects. The Blita hardlight cannon fires jets of these ionic pulses towards fighter crafts large enough to penetrate the hull then catalyze a short-circuit to adjecent electronics as it dissipates. Making such a weapon an odd but effective strike-craft killer.",Point Defense,,
ocua_fairy,WEAPON,"A second-generation Oculian plasma weaponry, equipped with a twin barrel mount and an even more powerful reactor for deadlier output.

More of a crude introduction as adding another barrel seemed appropriate for the pirates when they attempted to jam two Pixie cannons in one place.

The Arc Mother noticed this attempt and decided to build it accordingly. The additional barrel would mean less cooling time and more power demand as an empty barrel would demand a charge. Thus, the Fairy was made.",,,

ocua_gleam,WEAPON,"Upscaled for concentrated firepower, the Gleam is typically carried by larger warships of the Oculian armada due to its reliable precision to take out armored torpedoes.

Carrying the same flaws of the Glint laser cannon and more notably its strength as an anti-missile measure, the Gleam is essentially an equivalent of a microscope of the Glint comparison to a magnifying glass, taking advantage of its larger battery and a more potent crystal.",Anti-Fighter,,

ocua_kurtina,WEAPON,"Understandably the weakest beam weapon of its size, the Kurtina is an Oculian combat beam that provides fire support with the smallest energy footprint ever recorded in the Persean sector.

A true traditional Laser weapon in the hands of the Oculian Armada since the Collapse. As the earliest cycles when Arc Mother was establishing a foothold on Atalie Pax, Kurtina was previously used in mining operations benefitting its low emission trait that none of the Persean scanners would detect. The Kurtina is maintains a very low energy input, distributed through its three seperate barrels with intricately aligned crystals to produce the beams.",Close Support,,
ocua_leia,WEAPON,"Many consider this as the shoddy autopulse cannon, the Leia happens to thrive in efficiency and sustainability where the original cannot.

The Leia was immediately noticed as early on the Oculian conflicts when the first manned destroyers arrived for action. Short, but powerful bursts of energy endlessly pulsing within the sights of thermal detection sensors as the Hegemony fought on to claim what little territory they have on Haelim.",Assault,,
ocua_mi_manndie,WEAPON,"A near-perfected Laser canister weapon, with the capacity to materialize photon discharges to shatter within its victims. The Manndie pulse cannon is the Mikanate mainstay weapon that excels in crippling its enemies with its walls of hardened light.

After countless successes from the Leia laser canister cannon, a new variant had to be developed in order to maintain combat competitiveness against an ever evolving threat. The Manndie program was put to work which fabricated what is effectively a solid piece for the Oculian arsenal.

Three barrels, more photon compressors and an advanced targeting system allowed such a weapon to perform even at the most stressful environments. Pirates took it as more of an effective conventional weapon than what Tri-Tachyon would ever put on the market but often fell short for its terrible calculation requirements. ",Assault,,
ocua_ruby,WEAPON,"An even stronger hardlight weapon, repurposed with a goal of targeting large vessels over a longer distance, the Oculian Ruby as fondful poking tool made for the sadistic red gremlins.

Surprisingly, its secret lies heavily on how the barrel forces the weightless projectile out of its cylinder similarly how a physical bullet is propelled by conventional propulsion. The Armada had made sure that the amount of energy given to each shot is precisely at the right level, which is virtually inconceivable through handmade calculations.

Despite its exclusivity as an Oculian weapon, any ship who can get their hands on such a device. When it does, it can throttle as much piercing hardlight to any target with little punishment as possible from their own shooter.",Fire Support,,
ocua_freya,WEAPON,"The penultimate conclusion of the Pixie-plasma series, the Freya is simple but powerful weapon with the intention of ejecting loads of hot plasma within its general vicinity.

As if a small battery section of plasma cannons is already too much to take in, a singular but rotary platform of the entire section is produced to replicate the entire arsenal in the guise of one weapon. The Freya successfully fulfills its role as an aggressive option for captains who choose to go all in with their power design and throw as much damage to the enemy as they could think of.

Clearly a design that pirates suggested over the decoded lines when going through their recent raids with the Armada.",Assault,,
ocua_vira,WEAPON,"An industrialized step-up of the Oculian kinetic laser technology, the Vira can rip through the toughest of fighters with powerful high-intensity pulses.

A design fit for battleships that have to compete with carriers whom possess a varying degree of fighter compliments and corvette escorts where its smaller counterpart begin to fail its role, this weapon uses the same bolt firing systems with the extension battery charges to maintain its power over time.",Point Defense,,

Built with a dumb-AI drone installed, a Pixel can fly straight into the fray without any substantial consequence as the payload is too minimal to even be an effective weapon in the eyes of the defender.",Strike,,
ocua_shizuka,WEAPON,"A weapon system that boasts possibly the lowest yield of guided projectiles in its kind with the fastest and most efficient missile projection possible.

What size is almost essentially lobs of personal handheld grenades throttled by morbidly cheap thrusters makes the Kaze-family an eccentric example of Oculian military engineering. Mass produced by the millions, Kaze-missile launchers are able to split into three variants which the Oculians can use enmasse.

It was almost like the past has come back to haunt the modern days.",Close Support,,
ocua_sazanami,WEAPON,"Disposable, mid-yield guided missile rack, meant to generate weakspots for other Oculian weapons to unload at.

Much like its torpedo variant, this guidance-boosted missile system comes with a replacable rack and loader that compensates its low-grade design. This device so small compared to other launchers that allows a freedom of four explosive units instead of three.",Close Support,,
ocua_resel,WEAPON,"Rapidly-grown crystals at their poorest quality do not go to waste thanks to the rocket's lightweight assembly system. The smallest unit of the Resel series allows an ease of means to unload such destructive crystals to its target.

Not too long after mining procedures finished within the Adalie's inner crust, crystal farming went to full production to accomodate the supposed loss in time for military applications to reach cruiser doctrines. Such process of growing crystals in deep metal recycling often produces weak, unlinkable lenses that do little for laser amplification. With so much crystals in a poor state, the development to repurpose them obviously came to mind.

One of the options was laser fractalization such weapons like the Kea was able to fulfill in great success. The other is the Resel, an improvised missile technology that forego the use of electronics for guidance and is instead loaded with worthless crystals then launch them against a target with expectations of it being destroyed from within. At first, it seemed an amusing suggestion, but then it managed to succeed on what it meant to do. As electronics of the opposing Tri-Tachyon ships implode, as crystals shatter and began rupturing vital components that inevitably led to their destruction.",General,,
ocua_kilopixel,WEAPON,"An upscaled torpedo with the payload and tracking capability to match. Powerful enough to expose a large firepoint and do considerable damage.

Mikanate Kilopixels, while simple to reproduce in an assembly matrix, has been a weighty logistics issue for many Oculian captains.

ocua_suzuya,WEAPON,"A larger yet still disposable, low-yield guided missile rack, aimed for the purpose of maximized ballistics efficiency.

An outrageous design of 16 missiles on an external rack makes the Suzuya a popular weapon choice for low-grade pirates who are stingy enough to keep an active missile array while putting strain on other weapon types. Due to its below average yield, both economically and physically, the Suzuya is doomed for the status but is never disregarded as a reasonable threat not to be pointed at with.",Close Support,,
ocua_reselplus,WEAPON,"A moderate-scale Crystal payload launcher akin to the Annihilator rocket pod, this variant punishes poorly armored ships with its constant flow of unguided fragmenting rockets.

Not much was mentioned after industrializing crystal growth not just on Adalie but for the rest of the system.

ocua_macroxel,WEAPON,"A very large payload mix of crystals and explosives loaded into an armored shell of a torpedo. This weapon is made to inject its destruction upon a helpless vessel with a volume to match its resolution.

Easily confused as an oversized Pixel torpedo, this crystal-infused warhead does little to punch armor. Moreover, it does its destruction by widening the hole of the weakened bulkhead of the larger vessels. Its also worth noting about its survivability, thanks to its payload being crystals, the Macroxel is solid enough to withstand the opposing forces with such heavy point defenses.

The Oculian Armada seeks to minituarize this weapon as it provides a breathing room for cornered fleets as well, as fighters turn in horror were soon to discover a ring of crystal shards overwhelm their visuals when attempting to force a perimeter on a likely Oculian vessel.",Finisher,,

Harnessing its energy through not massive crystals but by a wide collection of glass-like belts that forces light to loop long for the intensity to generate enough kinetic energy to be unleashed in its opening, the Flandrey is more of a work of art than out of pure engineering. Its massive motors assist the turret in keeping the belts from loosening its light charge as it continues to fire the massive beam batteries.

Most Storkis vessels were not usually deployed outisde its primary design, a role that all of the Oculian sisters have experienced being in. Once a mysterious notion, this vessel was not known to be a time capsule, due to its simple and bulbous exterior much like most Oculian vessels at the time. But through closer inspection, it appeared to have been used for far longer than it supposed to, it even appeared to been there since before the Collapse.

The inner workings of such a device implied a suspicious nature, a potential that may have utilized the laws of relativity as the ship has never seen combat but more over been sped up in time. Throughout its true purpose, a Storkis uses its time accelerator as the craft slows in a speed unrelative to the time dilation normally experienced in sector. Thanks to the shell's unique composition, the transport withstand the rapid aging process as time flows faster within. With this process, it had been discovered that this craft is definitively a time capsule through its own intention with interiors that permit long-term habitation. And by that, it wasn't long until the pirates knew what happened when the first crafts successfully returned to Adalie.

Vacuum chambers, living spaces and virtual training areas may suggest that the sisters grew here. As time slows for everyone outside the craft, its inhabitants were released and underwent programs that would result to these soldiers, seen in action, in a much smaller time frame. While these same Storkis models may have been retrofitted for personnel transport, its former inhabitants of the ship felt a slight unease as their childhood memories now fly out of the shipyard for much more enduring tasks.",,,

Apparently, this Sunder design was appears to be of Hegemonic origins, but whether or not it was an act of betrayal or some twisted piracy that grants the Oculians technology for such a closely guarded design. At their earnest, an officer, managed to maintain anonyomity, was obliged on that goal and went with a message which was uncovered from the hull's wreckage:

""I cannot say much for what you twisted abonimations have been doing. And how much it has changed since you arrived in this God-forsaken sector. But for what you, and your godawful mother, have done is very inconceivable and an unwanted blessing.

It was that day forward where most of the Oculian vessels would come with its own factory line for its own on-board crew that lessen the upkeep costs, through remote material mining and harvesting. Paired with larger antimatter tanks and more efficient ion drives, the redesigned ships lose some combat performance, but only to be mitigated by their incredible mobility that the renewed ion drives provide.

Four missile batteries that no other ship could even accomodate the controls for every launched projectile, the Ignix' cheap but efficient computer systems allow multiple remote controls held by only a dozen crew members.

Essentially an empty shell with an Oculian bridge, an assembly matrix, engines and a few turrets directly mounted on the plastic chassis, Nimbyxes can never be landed on any planetary surface due to its fragile exterior. Instead, they perform freight services only in space as the weight acts more as a floating balance than to rip out its upper section upon leaving a planet's atmosphere.

Two of every battery each ship has ramp-up scores as they tirelessly scour through the Atalie system for any remaining invading fleet along with their carrier counterparts.

The Beatrix is a maddening weapon for Tri-Tachyon fleets, as this mobile laser battery generates a very large threat area, too large for any unprepared combatant to enter. Because firing off high-intensity beams that melt and tear through the toughest armors with a loud roar would always terrify the opposition.

An unusual assassin vessel, as one way to put it, the true purpose surrounding the Evalyx remains unclear as the resources used to build such a craft are too bold and too much for an investment. With phase coil technology and sizable cargo holds, it may serve itself as a contingency effort should the other Oculian vessels fail to meet their duties and required an unexpected approach to tackle with the situation.

The backbone of every Oculian strike fleet, the Nadia is a favored warcraft dearly upheld by the Oculians ever since their military debut in the Sector.

Bearing the sight of the Odyssey and Conquest philosophy, this broadside battleship is built to the task of combatting the opposition by its parallel arsenal with the commonly known poor ordinance in the sector. A hard contrast of what its offset siblings were able to achieve with a much more variable weapon batteries.

To circumvent this hurdle, the Nadia comes in terms of its reduces upkeep and a frontal shield drone to brace the hostile impacts it receives from similar battleships. The resulting design is comes of cleaner than anticipated; an atypical bulbous shell that has the capacity to use battleship weaponry and drone squadrons while intimidating the pirates by its complex but versatile retrofit structure.

Formerly under the rendition of the Kuria program, the Chimiria underwent several modifications only because of its massive size. The Arc Mother and several Oculian engineers were skeptical of its exact design philosophy, even when its original role is meant to be a mainstay carrier and a mobile self-sustaining bakery. Its hull underwent multiple changes, almost every decade, which costs the Tri-Tachyon invasions too much to reconsider retrofits.

This behavior evetnually became stagnant and inefficient for the Oculians, as every often these ships return and undergo overhaul taking additional effort where such could have been placed elsewhere. This led to its permanent design, hopefully, which came with a daunting task that took thousands of iterations in a single Chimirian cycle.

ocua_amina,SHIP,"A true warship introduced by the Oculian Aramada, designed from the very key role that would have described an Onslaught in the heat of combat. Instead of slow, primitive wrought armor-cladding, the lightweight Amina soars into deep space with speeds so fast, that it punishes the slower, immobile fleets.

Anagrammatically classified as the Amina-class, this thunderous bloat of plastic is meant to head straight to the frontlines, despite its lumbering size. With it, are powerful engines that provides massive emphasis on its speed, skimming through the seemingly frictionless vast of space with reckless abandon in very little time. The ionic drives that power the craft allowed a vast scale of armaments so large not even the mainline battleships of its class could compete.

Unlike most ships that utilize slow, sustained blasts from traditional Burn Drives, the Amina uses Ion Burst Drives with their short yet powerful pulses of energy to propel them at long distances. Due to its significantly small, but dense dispersal footprint, the Ion Burst Drive is suprisingly safe to handle on either side, so long as the Amina can hold its structural integrity upon sudden force of its thrust.",,,

An Oculian design that has just barely made an appearance in the current-day Sector, but shows great promise for the Oculian Armada's expansionist goals. A lightweight capital ship, the Etna-class is destined to explore deep space and harass anything that comes in its wake.

It is also noted that Arc-mother foreseen battleships being unlikely to respond fast enough while attempting to meet demands of high-powered arsenal. As tensions of the Armada in Hybrasil continue to develop, this new series of fuel-efficient, light warships ships begin to appear along with the dreadful Mikanate project.

Compared to the Nadia-class, the Etna is underequipped to compete most of the local doctrines. To circumvent this, it houses a more powerful reactor, accompanied with the same temporal device used by the Storkis models. The component would then overdrive the Etna, causing the ship to dilate much faster with a field behavior much more violent than its other counterparts. As the machine runs, time suddenly stands still from the outside, which the Etna now experiences.

A rare sight of such a juggernaut of a ship, this mobile construction facility harnesses its resources from whatever objects that can come close to it, thanks to its huge fleet of drones hidden in its own bulkhead. Large, curved holes behave like hornet pathways as the Breezes store every piece of material they could find, almost like an ecosystem. Polymer composites of, still, unknown properties, safe to the touch, breatheable for hours. An Oculian sister must have born specifically for a role on this ship. Upon walking in the hallways, are smooth, red surfaces, almost pristine even on a derelict vessel.

Imagining a battlefield with such a beast, made entirely of plastic and gems. A becoming of an unusual wonder. A vision of a Pandora being called, and almost every single drone falls in organized groups, each commanded by an Oculian sister. Only silence is heard in the radio channels within the Pandora's vincity. No one knew who or what are giving orders to the cloned monstrosities. Others would assume it would be the Arc Mother, but some say they communicate amongst themselves at a rapid rate.

Ships that befell from the might of a Pandora seen its actions, a simulateneous terror, a scene normally a horde of locusts would make in a harvest.

Successes of the modern battleship schools the Oculians adopted drew up a new intention to build more massive scale spaceborne warships in hopes to prevent system-wide blockades imposed by the Tri-Tachyon intervention. The Dulcena is more of a hidden pet project than an openly discussed forum to the pirates, as the size would be too much to handle or, let alone, grasp the concept of such a design.

Disposing its traditional hangar bays, the Dulcena prides purely on arsenal build-up, enough to scale against the Paragon and the Onslaught combined. Massive laser artilleries and missile compartments ensure its long-ranged capabilities remain its strong potential. Should improvision arise, it could adopt a large squadron of its own via its massive bulkhead to provide the size. Many would argue it partook the flagship retrofit of the Amina warship, though its mass and the poor capacity of the thrusters imply otherwise.

Nonetheless, a flagship that truly rivals its sister model, the Pandora, in terms of raw individual strength than utter dependency of the drone swarm technology.",,,

With Sagulum laser batteries on each side, the flagship makes short work with anything that comes remotely in her range long before the larger battlecruisers that are able to withstand the blinding torrent.

A typical staple of every fleet, Breeze drones are the weakest military units ever deployed by the Oculian Armada, but due to their relatively low resource value and menially simple controls, they can be produced enmasse and easily become a serious threat to any opposing navies.

Since it presents a small, bulbous design, the Breeze can accomodate all its necessities as a fighter, complete with a cheap and very conventional energy shield that keeps its fragile structure intact in the harsh depths of space. It comes with a standard Pulse Beam capable of tracking high-velocity missiles and speeding strike craft, which almost gurantees an accurate hit.",,,
ocua_breeze_mi,SHIP,"An advanced iteration of the Breeze drone, with the additional power to scale up their already overwhelming disposable numbers.

A slight increase of size on its bulbous frame implies that the inner workings of the Breeze has already been adjusted for the Mikanate program. The plastic frame appears to be double-layered, which is no surprise on how more expensive the electronics are in its inner workings.

Ion thrusters have also been rearranged and rescaled to meet the improved agility of the craft, along with sensors and a gyro-frameworks to allow sharp turns no matter direction the drone is facing. A remarkable design for such a fragile dronecraft.

The low-end ion batteries clearly help its minimal profiling, as well as the same pulse laser it keeps firing even when the probe is being carried directly into the facility.

It was not a coincidence that components installed within this wing was derived from an ancient bomber craft encountered in the old Domain era. An eeriely similar symbol emerged as the drone was meticulously dismantled, in an attempt to reverse engineer the design. Unfortunately, it was not possible due to the encryption and the materials that brought the weak automaton to existence.

Plastic components of unknown composition, which either imply reprocessed organics or something more sinister, which somehow get the Cancer afloat in space and on the planetary surface. Engines and a light chassis obviously attribute to this effect, but the torpedo it carries managed to meet allowance of its transport regardless.

While no other bomber seemed capable of reaching these properties, the Cancer tend to always break under physical interference in combat. A disposability that no bomber pilot would ever want to be a part of.",,,

Yet another example of the Oculian Armada's deceitful inventions, something so light yet it dictates its stressfully, heavy impact otherwise.

Presented along with it, two torpedo launch tubes with a disappointingly near-similar engine as means of propulsion. With the only difference is a thrust magnitude of twenty percent. Worse, it carries a larger computer core on-board, twice the lighter model's size.

And thanks to the same plastic components that piece the drone together, it is still becoming another failed attempt to reverse its design. A very unfortunate notion indeed.",,,

The most powerful design ever conceived in the Oculian's bombing technology so far. Despite the lack of progress with Tri-Tachyon's attempt to repurpose the bomber drone, it is no less weaker than most of the existing bombers in the battlefield.

A very modest amount of resources were still enough for the Pirates to build a squad in their microforges, and due to its painfully adoptable simplicity, a sizable carrier doctrine is enough to cause chaos against fleets twice their size.

ocua_kaleido,SHIP,"A frustrating, tenacious automaton to deal with, the Kaleido is a recent breakthrough for its persistence to keep power where most of the Breeze series cannot.

As attrition arises between Atalie Pax and Hybrasil, the Oculians look for a more efficient solution to prevent significant losses of interceptors that is still mobile and capable of carrying a strong barrier that is easily replenishable. Two battery banks and a shield generator were assembled for the template, then the chassis was built around it with the accomodation of a pair of weapon holds as the combat role still applies.

Once one decided to do so will likely to be in a Tick spacewalker, outfitted with a wide selection of tools that suit the pilot.

Battery armaments are attached to each of the two upper limbs, directly linked into the Ion-charged batteries that carry load compatible to the systems' voltage output. Laser canister weapons are the typical choice to due its weak energy density but powerful enough to melt through thick metal alloys though it is not impactful to kill a person outright. Low energy profile weapons are indeed the staple for the Oculian armory, which shamefully brought Tri-Tachyon's attention with attempts to steal their technology physically.

The Ticks can walk through one of the two modes; through its reversed bipedal legs, or the proleg hybrids hidden underneath the chassis' edges. Two movement features are substanstial for its portability, especially for ships that typically designed as carriers. As the prolegs are designed to move the walker subtly in enclosed spaces as its bulky main limbs cannot. The storage feature would have been on the carrier itself, but the designer who proposed the module required self-reliance as certain ships would not be able to perform such a task without compromising the hangars' hulls.

Ever since the pirates take hold on to Tick fighters, an elite variant was purposely manufactured to not count the discrepancies committed by its easily accessible counterpart.

Its cockpit harness is undoubtedly Oculian-restricted, as it requires two neuron nodes directly plugged into the craft to even allow its activation of its interface. Such node connectors are only found from the bunches of hair an Oculian possess which behave more like connection cables. Using normal human hair does not give a faithful result, however. Merely bursting the strands into flames as the nodes call for digital input, being that same input call happens to be electrical pulses.

Luckily, a severed, on the other hand, was an Oculian sister who had her wireless nodes severed from the network.

ocua,FACTION,"A peculiar entity with a development pattern unheard of by many technocrats after the Great Collapse, the Oculian Armada is an industrial robotics regiment that specializes in efficiency at massive numbers, harnesses the powers of the simple but practical design systems hardly seen in Tri-Tachyon facilities. Whether it is by a complete random chance or a coincidental awakening by human intervention, the Armada existed in the confines of its own purpose, to feed humanity with a produce it knew all too familiarly.

The Oculian Armada's true intentions are still shrouded in mystery, much to the Hegemony's suspicion. But are at least left alone with their devices in Atalie Pax, neighboring the system of Hybrasil, as a painful reminder to Tri-Tachyon for their terrible irresponsibility. In the Armada's earnest fruit, they proposed an aggressive marketing system for their exclusive commodities, a productivity so immense and of stable quality that many people in the Sector would have believed a capacity too good to be a well-meaningful intent. The cookies, the Oculian's primary export, was cut-off from the majority of the core planets but the pirates and independents who would at least seek for sustenance.

An active testament from the Luddics pressured on to distrust such heresy, of course. Even as Tri-Tachyon operations still pend on against the heart of the Armada, solely to capture the AI due to it continuing to provide human sustenance in such a welcoming persistence. Conflicts continue to clash, as the Armada attempt to reconcile to the sector, unbeknownst to the history that involved the AI wars, causing an already open gap to widen between them and the major factions. This left the Armada with its awakeners and self-made individuals to kindle what little trust they have.

The AI or ""EI"" as it referred itself as, also known as the Arc Mother, remains stalwart in defense against to her ongoing pursuers and ambitious to bring the sector into its well-fed state, creating the Armada as it is today with warships and mobile bakery facilities to meet that ambition. A persona recently made flesh for the purpose of improving the marketing value of their exports, becoming the progenitor of a new specimen within the span of a century, known as the Oculians. A fittingly odd human subspecies, that now walk the sector as ambassadors to an increasingly lucid and dark society that they may have indirectly attributed.",,,
