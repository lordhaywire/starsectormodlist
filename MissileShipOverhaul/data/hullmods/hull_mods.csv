Dual-Purpose Capacitor Banks,DPCHullmod,2,,,"offensive, merc",Weapons,9000,,,,5,10,15,25,data.hullmods.DPCHullmod,"By repurposing a portion of the flux capacitor banks, higher and more stable voltages can be maintained in the beam emmitter circuitry. In practical terms, this modification increases beam weapon range by %s and allows beam weapons to deal hard flux damage to shields, while reducing flux capacity by %s and flux dissipation by %s.",Increases potency of beam weapons at the cost of flux capacity and dissipation,/graphics/hullmods/dpchullmod.png
Overclocked Targeting Processor,OTPHullmod,2,,,"offensive, merc",Weapons,7500,,,,5,10,15,25,data.hullmods.OTPHullmod,"Since the computation of firing solutions is directly proportional to the speed of the targeting processor, increasing its speed beyond manufacturing limits results in improved combat performance. Faster target acquisition increases fire rate of non-missile weapons by %s and target-leading accuracy by %s, while faster radar return computing increases effective vision radius in combat by %s. However, such overclocking is only possible with severe overvolting of the processor, resulting in %s lower flux dissipation and %s increased overload duration.","Increases non-missile weapon fire rate, target leading accuracy and combat detection range at the cost of reduced flux dissipation and increased overload duration",/graphics/hullmods/otphullmod.png
Structural Cargo Retrofit,SCCRHullmod,2,,,"req_spaceport, merc","Logistics, Requires Dock",4000,,,,8,15,20,40,data.hullmods.SCCRHullmod,"Any ship can be turned into a cargo freighter if the mission requires it. By stripping out %s of the ship's armor and %s of its bulkheads, it is possible increase the cargo space aboard by %s (depending on the ship's armor) while maintaining relative hyperspace-worthiness of the vessel. Engaging in combat in such a configuration is ill-advised, and, furthermore, should the ship be lost, it's recovery chance will be %s lower.",Removes most of the ship's armor and bulkheads in order to add more cargo space.,/graphics/hullmods/sccrhullmod.png
High-Performance Missile Propellant,HPMPHullmod,2,,,"offensive, merc",Weapons,6000,,,,5,10,15,25,data.hullmods.HPMPHullmod,"With the help of certain highly energetic compounds and a complete booster stage redesign, it is possible to increase missile speed by as much as %s, as well as achieve a %s units longer range, at the cost of %s lower maneuvrability and %s reduced missile durability due to the highly energetic nature of the propellant.",Increases missile top speed and range at the cost of maneuverability and durability,/graphics/hullmods/hpmphullmod.png
