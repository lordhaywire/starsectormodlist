mod_kernera,SHIP,"The Kernera-class is a dedicated long-range missile support cruiser. Its two large missile hardpoints offer substantial firepower, while its decent mobility allows it to effectively disengage from most ships that outgun it. Its main weakness lies in its inability to effectively engage frigates and destroyers, rendering it very vulnerable if unsupported.",,,,
mod_aposeris,SHIP,"In order to reduce the possibility of strikecraft pilot shortages and mitigate its severity, a new missile destroyer based on the Drover-class light carrier hull was developed. Its pilot quarters and fighter hangars were replaced by missile racks and autoloaders wihle the launch bays gave way to twin large missile hardpoints. Additionally, the hull was narrowed and engines upgraded, increasing the top speed of the vessel.",,,,
mod_carnage,SHIP,"The Carnage-class battleship is a relatively modern design meant to bridge the gap between fast modern cruisers and older, larger capital ships like the Conquest-class. Sporting a quad large composite battery, the Carnage-class vessels offer unmatched versatility on the battlefield.",,,,
mod_zeal,SHIP,"The Zeal-class was designed as a direct upgrade to the Vigilance-class in order to bring adequate frigate-based missile support to mid-tech fleets. The main change between the two frigates is a double medium missile battery on the Zeal-class, which effectively doubled the firepower of the Vigilance-class. During development, the new Zeal-class vessels were deemed to possess inadequate mobility to effectively pursue and disengage, which led to the decision to use the remaining machinery compartment space for additional engine upgrades instead of fast missile racks as was the case on the Vigilance-class.",,,,
mod_ardor,SHIP,"Originally developed as a successor to the Aurora-class high-tech cruisers, the Ardor-class boasts increased versatility and firepower with few, if any, downsides.",,,,
mod_eventide,SHIP,"The Eventide-class is essentially a streamlined version of the Apogee-class, sporting twin front-facing large energy hardpoints instead of a missle launcher. Perigee-class cruisers are fast, versatile and well-armed ships that can take punishment as well as dish it out.",,,,
mod_vertex,SHIP,"The Vertex-class heavy cruiser is characterized by overwhelming firepower in a relatively compact package. These ships have the ability to obliterate anything smaller than themselves, while remaining fast enough to effectively disengage from most better-armed ships.",,,,
mod_ichor,SHIP,Ichor-class cruisers are highly versatile and very well-armed vessels that can go toe-to-toe with most threats in the sector.,,,,
mod_atomizer,SHIP,"While the Eradicator-class was able to fulfill its role as a fast cruiser, it lacked sufficient staying power in large engagements, leading to the development of the Atomizer. These cruisers had an improved reactor core, an additional large ballistic weapon mount and were able to be outfitted as makeshift missile support ships if the mission required it. Although the initial prototypes proved unacceptably slow, this was later rectified with a significant engine upgrade, allowing them to keep up with lighter Eradicators, albeit at a higher fuel and maintenance cost.

Post-Collapse, the Atomizer-class again sees active service in the sector's naval forces, mostly as a reliable and dependable option for a frontline combat vessel.",,,,
mod_instigator,SHIP,"Although not as well armed as the feared Onslaught-class, the Instigator-class battleships offer heavier armor, better maneuvrability and overall greater versatility, both on the battlefield, as well as off it.",,,,
mod_pulsar,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the TriTachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

Although operationalized in the Retribution design, the Orion Drive was never popular with crew or naval architects due to the great strain each jolt the propulsion system inflicted upon flesh and hardware. The Pulsar overcomes such limitations by dispensing with human crew altogether. The Orion Drive design thus freed from most burdensome constraints, every aspect could be upgraded to higher power levels using cutting-edge weapons technology and advanced solid-state Tri-Tachyon-designed components. The result is an AI-operated battlecruiser capable of fearsome speed and firepower.",,,,
mod_sepulcher,SHIP,"A design dating to the first explosive expansion of the Domain, this gargantuan mass of armor and all-big-guns was the gauntleted fist that smashed all opposition, spreading hegemony by fear and force over all of spacefaring humanity that was worth conquering.

The steady march of military technology left the hull outdated, however. Its armor design was incompatible with early shield generators, its minimum crew complement staggering, and targeting systems unsophisticated. Modernized replacements were soon developed and the Onslaught-class, among others, was churned out by the great Domain forges.

However, unlike the Domain which ended up phasing out these absurd cathedrals of war out in favor of smaller, cheaper and more modern alternatives, the Hegemony leadership instead saw great potential in them and made considerable effort to modernize and intoduce them into their naval forces, resulting in the modern Bulwark-class dreadnoughts. While these huge vessels aren't even remotely cheap or efficient to operate, their maintenance, at least on the technical level, is surprisingly staightforward due to the sheer simplicity of the installed systems.",,,,
mod_pillager,SHIP,"A resilient design often overlooked by history, the Pillager-class fast cruiser features powerful dual engine nacelles, as well as an experimental ""Orion Drive"" which uses high-yield ordnance to propel the ship forward at ludicrous speeds,  allowing it to deliver uncompromising firepower and a powerful missile barrage to the weakest point of the enemy battleline - or come to the rescue of valuable assets that have found themselves tactically exposed.

The physical stress inflicted upon both human flesh and ship components by the propulsive jolts made the Pillager an unpopular ship in the Domain Armada, one of only a handful of opinions shared whole-heartedly by crew and officers alike. Only a handful of examples were ever deployed by the Armada proper, the Pillager finding more use among frontier mercenaries and pirate-hunters that relied upon unexpected bursts of speed and hyper-aggressive tactics. However, advancing technology and changing tactical doctrine brought these ships back into service, unfortunately for their crews.",,,,
mod_pontiff,SHIP,"The Pontiff-class heavy cruiser is a versatile warship featuring two large and four medium weapon mounts, making it a solid and capable contender, able to face capital ships on the battle-line.
A relatively recent design, the Pontiff is a product of the historically recent ""Cruiser School"" naval revolution that never saw active service in the pre-collapse Domain Armada. Although prototypes were constructed and forge-ready specifications distributed to several battlegroups, the Pontiff was never cleared for active deployment due to an ongoing lawsuit between Altair Exotech and Orion Shipyards. Each megacorp accused the other of industrial espionage and inappropriately influencing the Armada officers overseeing the procurement process. The truth was more complex, inflaming longstanding rivalries in the officer corps as the investigatory committee called witness after witness. The Collapse prevented any sort of conclusive ruling from reaching the Persean Sector however, and now the entire matter is considered irrelevant. With the discovery of Pontiff plans on a Domain armaments courier, the warship was quickly put into service by the fleet of the Persean League, among others.	",,,,
mod_vitriol,SHIP,"An ancient design, the Vitriol is a heavy cruiser which dates to the renaissance of military experimentation during the first consolidation period of the Domain. These ships were first envisioned as relatively fast system defense cruisers, however, they ultimately proved incapable of effectively pursuing smaller ships, leading to the development of the Retribution-class battlecruiser which traded armor and weight for speed and sported an experimental ""Orion Drive"" pulse propulsion system, which came with its own problems.

While not the fastest of ships, the Vitriol-class cruisers were still very versatile combat vessels, carrying substantial firepower and being quite well armored for their time. As time passed, these ships were slowly phased out in favor of more modern Dominator-class cruisers, but they never became entirely obsolete due to being designed by surprisingly forward-thinking engineers, explaining its continued use in post-collapse fleets.",,,,
