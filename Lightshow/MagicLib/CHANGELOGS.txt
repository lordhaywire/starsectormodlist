Added MagicIndustryItemWrangler:
   - Courtesy of Wyvern.
   - Allows mods to define "rating" for their items that can be mounted in the same industries as other items.

   - Variables should now properly get replaced in the conclusion intel.
   - Fixed another source of crashes from HVB conversions.
   - Accepted bounties are now placed in the "MISSION" intel tab rather than bounties.

   - Fixed an issue with the quality setting that was modifying the Flagship and Preset ships loadouts to fit its value,
   - Flagship and escort ships now keep their original variants unless the autofitter is specifically allowed to alter them.

[RC3]
MagicCampaign.placeOnStableOrbit(): Fixed not one but two effing stupid mistakes! Affected both the Diable Avionics unique ships and the Plague-Bearer ones.
MagicBounty HVBs: improved the validation check so that it does not freak out on empty fields.

Huge thanks to Wisp that did the bulk of the work, to Schaf-Unschaf and Rubi for their contributions.

Added a merged "occupied" system themes list to MagicSetting, for finding suitable places where to spawn exploration content. Currently adds all the Remnant tags, Blade-Breaker, OCI and Plague-Bearer tags.

0.29

Added MagicInterferencePlugin
   . Makes exceptionally strong weapons with the "Interference" trait have negative effects when more that one is mounted on a given ship.
   . Those weapons need to trigger the plugin to check for possible other interference sources from a CSV file.
   . If other sources are found, it will add a hullmod that reduced the ship's dissipation depending on the number of interfering weapons and their interference strength.

Added MagicBasicInterferenceEffec loose weapon script to trigger an interference check.

Added MagicIncompatibleHullmods
   . Proposes a uniform "incompatible hullmod" solution.
   . When triggered as two incompatible hullmods are added, it will remove the offending hullmod and add a hullmod to warn the player about that operation.
