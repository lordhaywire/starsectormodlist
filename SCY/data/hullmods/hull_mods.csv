Scyan Engineering,SCY_engineering,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.SCY_engineering," The Scyan Engineering College optimizes its designs for hunter-killer purposes: While the ships are slightly more expensive to deploy compared to the average standard hull, they can stay in ambush longer thanks to their reduced maintenance. Additionally, compared to the average ships in the Sector, the fleet has:
 %s burn,
 %s better engines,
 %s flux reserves,
 %s vent rates,
 %s sensor profile while laying still;
at the cost of:
 %s flux dissipation,
 %s armor, shield efficiency and weapon slots,
 %s sensor profile while moving.
 The standardized singular engine is %s sturdier and faster to repair than conventional engines but %s support any further performance enhancement.","Faster ships that vent quickly, few weapons and little dissipation.",graphics/SCY/hullmods/SCY_engineering.png

Modular Armor,SCY_armorplating,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.SCY_modularArmor," This modular armor is a recent innovation that allows specially fitted ships to drop these extremely massive armored plates when they no longer provide an effective protection.

Lightweight Plating,SCY_lightArmor,2,,Scyan Engineering,"defensive, special","Defenses",5000,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,5,10,15,25,data.hullmods.SCY_lightArmor," Replacing the original armor plating with lightweight alloys increases maneuverability and acceleration by %s percent, and raises the top speed by %s.

 This weaker protection however reduces the armor rating by %s percent. The lack of hull integrated flux management systems reduce the ship's dissipation and capacity by %s. Finally, securing the ship to cope with increased acceleration raises the cost of deployment by %s percent.

 The ship is however less suited to wistand other types of impacts and take %s percents more damage from Energy and %s percents more from Kinetic weapons.

 Best suited for ships with already strong armor to make it more durable.","Drastically reduce HE damage to the ship's armor, raises the other type's damage.",graphics/SCY/hullmods/SCY_reactiveArmor.png
