   . The normal Manticore Carrier now has only two flight-decks but gains a large sideway missile hardpoint. 
   . The Extended one loose two small turrets, most of it's cargo, it's drone ship-system has been replaced by flares and is a bit more expensive and much rarer.

BALANCING
 - Hemor mkIII: damage raised to 650 per shot from 500, flux cost raised to 2000 from 1500, rate of fire lowered to 24 rpm from 25, slightly improved precision. (in line with the Hellbore)

V0.96
03/08/2015

NEW CONTENT
 - Added the Heavy ENB: An up-sized energy version of the Triple Energy Blaster that can fire continuously for moderate damage. Used as a cheaper Plasma cannon with constant pressure.
 - Added the Converted Heavy ENB: A ballistic conversion of the Heavy ENB in the same fashion as it's medium sized counterpart. Short-ranged and ammo limited, but higher burst damage and very easy to install. Used as a Mjolnir knock-off with better armor penetration.

BALANCING
 - Significant weapon balance tweaks:
   . The combat stats of most weapons didn't changed, however their OP cost has been lowered to low-tier vanilla. 
   . Scy weapons are now cheap to install but short ranged and very flux hungry. 
   . This should make them competitive alternatives to vanilla weapons, powerful but sharply raising the risk of overloads.
 - All Scy ships have had their OP amount reduced accordingly, making them a bit starved when installing higher tier vanilla weapons.
 - Significant shield balance tweaks:
   . All shields are now in line with vanilla in the amount of damage they can soak. A bit down for the frigates (except for the Talos), slightly up for the cruisers, significantly up for the capital-ships.
   . Passive Flux dissipation while the shields are online further reduced.
   . Given the now reduced OP that scale less with the Player levels, this should makes Scy ships better in the early game but equivalent later on.
 - Euryale's "Networked targeting system" is now passive with an explicit AOE visual cue. The ship now has a drone ship-system. Small buff to it's effect: 25/20/15/10% damage and range bonus from 20/15/10/5%.

 - Slight graphic upgrade for the Triple Energy Blaster, the Focused Pulse Beam, the Enhanced Focused Pulse Beam, the Anti-missiles launcher, the Burst Nailer, the SCPB.
 - Significant cleanup in the scripts, should result is a small performance improvement during large battles, less particles clipping and more consistent effects with unstable frame-rates.
 - Reworked missiles flight pattern for the Coasting Missiles, the Heavy Modular Swarmer and the Anti-Missiles. Small performance improvement.
 - Added lights info for ShaderLib users.
 - All fighters variants have their own hull with the weapons built-in to prevent those from (rarely) dropping in the post-battle loot.

   . The Armored stheno traded the secondary thrusters of it's light declination for an Assault Shield ship system.

 - slightly increased the effect of the Area Scorcher against missiles and fighters.
 - Removed all built-in Augmented Engines and Maneuvering Thrusters. Though you still can't mount them or the Unstable Engines.

 - The Khalkotauroi now uses TWIG lib for it's Accelerator Pods. Those can now be shot off, permanently reducing the power of the main beam for the battle. 
   . Modified the sprite accordingly.
 - Reduced the range buff of the Precision Gear ship system.
