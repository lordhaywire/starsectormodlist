prv_broadsword_pather,SHIP,"With its right side armament and armor ripped out and replaced by a torpedo mount the Pather Broadsword is a terrifying implement of holy war capable of devastating bombing runs.

Fanatics of the Luddic Path have managed to crudely modify a still-encrypted Broadsword master production chip, creating a blueprint for a vehicle that could potentially operate as the Path's primary strike bomber. Replacing the left-hand machinegun with a light mortar and most of the right side of the fighter's hull with a Hammer launch rail the strike potential of the vehicle is undeniably intimidating. Unfortunately the unpredictable and poorly understood modifications have also degraded the performance of the engine. Pather engineers attempt to get around this by mounting a modified exhaust nozzle in post-production, but it only helps so much.

The torpedoes fit to these vessels tend to have numerous and often intricate and artistic blessings and prayers drawn on them, in the hopes that providence will guide the Hammer to strike true. Certainly, once the rocket engine has ignited the lack of a guidance system leaves it entirely out of the hands of man.",,,
prv_talon_pather,SHIP,"Faster and cheaper than ever, this overtuned vehicle of holy war sports surprising firepower and is capable of dispatching enemy fighters. It can also deal appreciable damage to larger ships when used en masse, though such use usually results in heavy pilot losses. To help absorb such losses more readily the Pathers operate the fighter in larger wings than Domain doctrine would demand.",,,
