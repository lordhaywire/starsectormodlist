TTE_lamm,SHIP,The corporation designed this High-Tech medium tanker with enough fuel capacity to support a medium to large fleet. Tanker duty is often considered drudge work and usually given to newly appointed ship captains so the designers added additional creature comforts including more crew quarters to add a fourth watch.,Tanker,,
TTE_olmedreca,SHIP,"With the newly constructed stations, the corporation designed this High-Tech extra capacity tanker in order to meet the demands of added supply routes in an efficient and cost effective manner. Exploration fleet Admirals also use this ship when looking for new opportunities to profit from the deep expanse of the sector.",Tanker,,
TTE_rabaroansa,SHIP,"Corporate executive Admirals, tired of relying on the aging Colossus, felt they needed a modern heavy freighter to accompany their fleets. With luxury accommodations and a larger cargo hold, this ship was designed for the captain that appreciates the finer things. Fitted with an additional burn drive, it can accompany other High Tech ships, but to make room for the additional amenities, its armor and hull are greatly reduced. ",Heavy Freighter,,
TTE_involucra,SHIP,"Tri-Tachyon’s decision to no longer field carriers in their fleets had Corporate Admirals reliant on High Tech designs hard pressed for wing support. With the overabundance of low tech Mora hulls available on the market, a savvy engineer purchased a bulk lot of decommissioned ships on the cheap, and with some computer-assisted redesign was able to commission the Involucra. By replacing its heavy armor plating with lighter weight high tech polymers and balancing the flight hangars to face the ship's front, they were able to increase speed and maneuverability at the cost of some additional crew to man the added systems required for an all energy weapon loadout. ",Hybrid Cruiser,,
TTE_braijsa,SHIP,The Braijsa is the corporations answer to the Hegemony’s Dominator. A well made High Tech ship intended for system defense around Tri-Tachyon worlds and outposts. Not as well armored as its low tech analog it is nevertheless a sleek and deadly predator intended to be a front line anchor in any fleet. ,Heavy Cruiser,,

TTE_pdpulse,WEAPON,"This hybrid weapon design was made by taking the base of the Minipulsar and retrofitting it with smaller capacitors, faster turret gyros and a targeting package from the mining laser hardwired for missile and fighter defense. For captains that prefer pulse weaponry, it is a cheap and long-ranged PD option, but hampered by its low power output.",,,
TTE_pb,WEAPON,"Faced with the tendencies of their enemies to prioritize the use of low tech ships, Tri-Tachyon designed this weapon to fire repeating bolts of explosive plasma at long range. Due to the high flux per shot it will prioritize firing when shields are down to maximize its potential. Its high per-shot impact causes shock waves that can dislodge armor plating.",,,
TTE_ionburst,WEAPON,"A long range energy pulse weapon designed to drain shields. Each pulse deals a portion of its damage as electromagnetic pulse (EMP) damage, which can disable surface systems of ships such as weapons and engines. It is notably flux efficient, but it is more expensive to equip than other medium energy weapons. When hitting hull or armor an EMP arc will form in addition to the direct damage, potentially striking weapons or engines far from the impact point.",,,
TTE_lplasma,WEAPON,"A scaled down version of the Plasma Cannon intended for ships with tighter ordinance budgets. The shell is a microfusion bomb which uses gravitic and baryonic lens to focus its energy inward. The resulting explosion creates plasma which is contained by a temporary mini-universe anomaly, while magnetic drivers mounted on the forward pylons accelerate it toward the target. The containment field intensity has been strengthened to allow the shell to reach its target at the extended range.",,,
TTE_lef,WEAPON,"The Light Energy Flechette is an Ion energy bolt that is similar in many respects to the classic Ion Cannon, albeit firing significantly less powerful bolts and with many of the latter's more advanced features removed.
