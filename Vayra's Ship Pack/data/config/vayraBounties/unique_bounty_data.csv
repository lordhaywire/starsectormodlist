All domination is ultimately based on the triumph of the unworthy over the many, the cruel over the innocent. Do you know what my crime was? To dream of a world of freedom, a world where a woman might stand on her own rather than cowing and worshipping at the ruined corpse of the Domain.

To make the distinction unmistakably clear: Freedom is the vital force in human history, our history; Hegemony is that inert mass of institutions and organizations which accumulate around and tend to drag down the advance of life; Freedom is Arkadiy Innokenti facing death by fire; Hegemony is the Domain Intelligence Service, after sixty-two years of inquisition, sending him to the wall; Freedom is mutual aid and self-defense; Hegemony is the judge, the lawbook and the forces of Law; Freedom is uprising, insurrection, revolution; Hegemony is the war of state against state, or of machines against people, as in the fringe systems and Magec; Freedom is tolerance, detachment and humor, or passion, anger, revenge; Hegemony is the entrance examination, the planet-killer, the doctoral dissertation and the summary execution; Freedom is the heroes of the Askonian Revolutionary Council fighting the Persean League, then the Diktat, then the Hegemony, then the Diktat again; Hegemony is Andrada and the Diktat itself; Freedom is Ludd granting us freedom from the tired thanatarchy of the Domain; Hegemony is the Pathers dedicated to tearing down all of the old and the new alike; Freedom is a youth with an antimatter-catalyzed fusion grenade in her hand; Hegemony is the League militiaman or Tri-Tachyon enforcer that guns her down; Freedom is the wild river; Hegemony, 592,000 tons of cement; Freedom flows; Hegemony thickens and coagulates, like tired, sick, stifled blood.
