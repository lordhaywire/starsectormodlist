antediluvian_azores,SHIP,"The Azores is, even among the ancient ships of the Antediluvian Armada, something of a relic. Originally designed as a prototype for the ionized gas engines of the first Atlantean spacefarers, it has since gained a fearsome reputation as a light attack craft despite its aging flux core design and lack of a shield emitter.",,,
antediluvian_forlorn,SHIP,"The Forlorn-class is a sleek heavy frigate fitted for combat and exploration, capable of operations both in liquid and aether. Equipped with superior ballistic weapons and an exeperimental phase-slip aether submersion system, it excels at hit-and-run tactics against larger enemies.",,,
antediluvian_pressure_gun,WEAPON,"A pair of high pressure rifled barrels, fitted upon a rotating base. Special hydraulics allow for this turret to expel slugs of metal at incredible velocity regardless of exterior pressure, making the pressure gun ideal for underwater and extra-planetary duty.",Point Defense,,
antediluvian_torpedo_launcher,WEAPON,"A high pressure launcher, capable of propelling titanium-shelled high explosive torpedoes at high initial velocity both underwater and in space. The torpedoes carry a small reservoir of ionized gas propellant, allowing them an extended range albeit at a much lower cruising speed once their initial launch velocity is lost to liquid/aether friction.",Strike,,
antediluvian_solon_blaster,WEAPON,"Using a modified drum-chamber to create intense gravitic vibrations, the Solon Blaster is capable of producing ripples in the very fabric of space. These ripples are propelled forward in a directed pulse, shattering matter in their path. The flux requirements of the device, unfortunately, are just as formidable as the damage it can cause.",Assault,,
antediluvian_reflector,WEAPON,"A beam weapon that can cover large distances and is effective in both water and space, the Reflector is the Antediluvian Empire's answer to phase-capable or shielded targets. High-energy particles are passed through a series of nano-reflective pools within the chassis before refraction through a gravitic prism, causing catastrophic overload to shield systems hit by the weapon.",Close Support,,
antediluvia_submerge,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A prototype phase-class ship system, charging the surrounding aether with phase energies and submerging the ship to leave it suspended between dimensions and impervious to attack. Due to not fully entering p-space, power consumption is higher and time dilation less significant than with typical phase cloaks. However, the detrimental effect on the crew's psyche is also considerably lessened.",Defensive,"Submerges the ship in phase-charged aether, rendering it impervious to attacks.",
vayra_battleaxe,SHIP,"The Battleaxe borders on corvette- or light frigate-sized, but lacks its own integrated travel drive and must rely on carrier or tender vessels for transport and deployment. Armed with a diverse array of weaponry, the Battleaxe is commonly seen in an escort role protecting Hegemony trade convoys and light strike detachments.",,,
vayra_groundhog,SHIP,"A heavy utility frigate originally designed for high-risk resource extraction in dense asteroid fields and planetary debris, the Groundhog has surprising mobility for its mass thanks to a wide network of maneuvering thrusters. Heavily armored and boasting a military-grade flux core design, it is frequently lauded by independent mining captains as an excellent light freighter and salvage ship - one that poses at least as much of a deterrent to pirates as any escorts that might be deployed alongside it.",,,
vayra_tyrant,SHIP,"The Tyrant-class fast battleship is considered by some to be ahead of its time, having been developed in the late Mastery epoch - long before the Domain's later adoption of fast capital designs such as the Conquest- and Odyssey-class battlecruisers. Although generally scorned by naval commanders of the era in favor of the much more heavily armed and armored Onslaught, the aptly named 'Tyrant' was put to use in a number of engagements against anti-Domain rebel groups on the galactic fringe and developed a reputation as a fearsome - if still infrequently deployed - combatant.",,,
vayra_oppressor,SHIP,"Occupying a comfortable place on the spectrum between ponderous, menacing heavy cruisers, sturdy carriers, and more agile but less well-defended lighter craft, the Oppressor is most commonly seen deployed in system defense fleets where its relative mobility, omnidirectional shield emitter, and ample light weapon arrays allow it to provide point defense cover and fighter support to Dominator-class line assault and artillery ships.

Having been supplanted by the Eagle as the Armada's primary line cruiser, many examples of the class were relegated by the Domain to second-line units and defense forces in galactic backwaters such as the Persean Sector. Thanks to the Hegemony's revival of early-Domain ""Decisive Battle"" fleet doctrine, Oppressor-class cruisers can once again be found on the stellar battlefield; where their fighter squadrons and massed banks of weaponry prove just as formidable against pirates and corporate raiders as they once did against anti-Domain rebels.",,,
vayra_subjugator,SHIP,"Equipped with primarily light weaponry besides a Thermal Pulse Lance built into the bow of the hull, the Subjugator-class fast cruiser devotes a disproportional amount of displacement to engine capacity. With mobility well in excess of some contemporary destroyers, it excels in a role as a hunter and killer of lighter craft or aggressive assault ship against stations and larger vessels.",,,
vayra_persecutor,SHIP,"An uncompromisingly effective combat vessel, the Persecutor is agile enough to catch and kill slower frigates and other destroyers - and poses a credible threat to larger vessels as well, thanks to specialized ammunition loading systems which allow it to achieve unparalleled weight of fire for its class. 

Many overconfident cruiser officers have met their deaths at the wrong end of the Persecutor's devastating ballistic firepower. Pirate and corporate-backed raider captains across the sector have gone so far to nickname it the 'Angel of Death' in reference to its distinctive flying-wing silhouette, and some veteran destroyer and frigate captains will go so far as to refuse to engage Persecutors without overwhelming support - a behaviour that they often credit for their survival to veterancy.",,,
vayra_intimidator,SHIP,"In the bloody cycles since the collapse, the Intimidator-class destroyer has found favor with both Hegemony junior command officers, who appreciate its access to strike craft support; and Logisticarum bureaucrats, who appreciate its ease of repair and maintenance thanks to an abundance of parts shared with the Enforcer-class combat destroyer which it is often deployed alongside.

Originally designed to provide fire support and interceptor cover in light combat flotillas, the Intimidator had the misfortune of being sent for its first major production run just before the ""Cruiser School"" fleet doctrine became popular in Domain naval procurement committees. Quietly pulled from production and brushed under the rug in favor of more specialized and dedicated light carrier designs, Intimidator hulls were sequestered in vast orbital hangars by the hundreds and shipped off to ""reinforce"" system defense units in fringe provinces such as the Persean Sector.",,,
vayra_bruiser,SHIP,"Once typically deployed in support of port authority and system defense patrols, the Bruiser-class frigate was nonetheless eventually replaced in Domain-era naval doctrine by the archetypical Brawler with the advance of so-called ""Core Epoch"" ship designs. Despite being decommissioned in every fleet the Domain of Man deemed of importance, numerous examples of the class survived in backwaters such as the Persean Sector - where their heavy armament, armor, and ease of maintenance have won them a certain degree of respect unlikely to fade with the introduction of newer and less-proven designs.",,,
vayra_hatchetman,SHIP,"A tried-and-true design for a fast and aggressive gun cutter, the Hatchetman was eventually phased out of the Domain's naval stock with the introduction of the Wolf. Despite a power core design which frankly bordered on obsolete even during the epoch of its production, the Hatchetman combines mobility with more than enough firepower to pose a threat on the battlefield - especially when approaching on a well-timed micro-burn aimed directly at its opponents engines.",,,
vayra_swordsman,SHIP,"A potent attack frigate designed around a suite of powerful engines and versatile weapon mounts. A sturdy shield generator leaves the Swordsman more than capable of taking some punishment in the line of battle, despite its relatively light armor.

With the phasing out of the venerable Lasher at the beginning of the Core Era, the Domain found itself faced with an unforeseen gap in its fleet doctrine: While heavily armed Brawlers and Hammerheads excelled at delivering ballistic kill power in small-to-medium fleet engagements, it lacked a speedy fast attack craft for deployment at the combat patrol level. The Swordsman, originally a testbed for prototype modular energy weaponry, was quickly militarized and put into production to fill this opening.",,,
vayra_huntress,SHIP,"A fast, aggressive light destroyer, bristling with thruster outlets and weapon mounts. While not capable of mounting heavy anti-ship weapons, the Huntress excels in its role as a fleet picket and light outrider; chasing down and forcing engagements with smaller ships, against which it can take advantage of its superior shields and flux handling to emerge victorious.",,,
vayra_tac_drone,SHIP,"Athame-class support pods are frequently deployed as supplementary defense craft for rear-line carriers. Small, lacking a shield emitter, and essentially unarmored, they rely on their long-ranged weaponry and the point defense gunners of their escort targets for protection. With time-to-live in a hostile battlespace measured in single-digit seconds, assignment to one is widely regarded by fighter pilots in the sector as a death sentence.",,,
vayra_battlement,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Battlement is a hulking behemoth of a drone cruiser, mating thick bulkheads and heavy armor to a centrally located forge vat capable of supplying its primary missile batteries with ammunition more or less indefinitely. Somewhat alarmingly, records preserved from the Domain indicate that the missile autoforge technology used by the Battlement significantly postdates the departure of the initial Explorarium sporeships and motherships bound for the Persean Sector.",,,
vayra_motte,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The cruiser-scale Motte-class carrier drone was designed to operate in concert with the Bailey-class drone fighter, capable of being deployed en masse to escort Explorarium motherships in passage through rebel-controlled fringe sectors or dense asteroid fields. Armed with a respectable battery of light strike or blasting missiles as well as radial point defense guns, it also saw some use on the fringes as a support vessel in engagements against anti-Domain rebels with significant fighter presence.",,,
vayra_bailey,SHIP,"Autonomous AI heavy fighter for use by Domain automated warships. Commonly deployed by Motte-class automated carriers, the Bailey is a tough - if somewhat sluggish - strike craft that relies on a decoy flare launcher as well as its thick hull and armor to give it excellent loiter time in engagements.",,,
vayra_castellum,SHIP,"Autonomous AI rocket bomber for use by Domain automated warships. Commonly deployed by Motte-class automated carriers, the Castellum is a slow but dependable drone bomber carrying a single rack of Annihilator explosive rockets.",,,
vayra_ditch,SHIP,"Autonomous AI interceptor for use by Domain automated warships. Commonly deployed by Motte-class automated carriers, the Ditch is an agile interceptor drone equipped with a pair of vulcan cannons and a single-launch decoy flare system.",,,
vayra_fortress,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A rare example of a Domain-era drone equipped with modular energy hardpoints, Fortress-class automated cruisers seem to serve the dual purpose of resource extraction and heavy fire support. Capable of stripping an asteroid or comet to its component molecules in a matter of minutes, the Fortress's fearsome array of directed energy weaponry serves just as well against harder targets such as cruisers and capital ships. Incorporating technology centuries more advanced than most Explorarium drones, the Fortress must have been designed relatively late in the Domain's history. How it came to be carried in the Mothership's memory banks... Remains unclear.",,,
vayra_redoubt,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The destroyer-scale Palisade drone is a fast and aggressive automated warship, constrasting starkly with other Explorarium drones as a vessel clearly designed for war. Curiously, according to the scattered histories that have survived the Collapse, the Palisade was first deployed in combat against anti-Domain rebels several decades after the Explorarium Mothership destined for the Persean Sector departed on its journey.",,,
vayra_tower,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The heavily armed Tower-class drone is a standby of Explorarium automated task forces, constructed and deployed as needed when the Mothership accumulates enough evidence to suggest that it faces a 'heightened' threat level. Carrying a medium ballistic weapon backed up by several light hardpoints and an overcharged autoloader system, it is capable of posing a threat to dedicated warships - at least on the lighter end of the scale.",,,
vayra_tarsus_ii,SHIP,"Segments of armor plating from a damaged or destroyed Conquest-class battlecruiser have been grafted around the hull of this Tarsus-class freigher, turning the formerly unassuming civilian hull into a formidable ship of the line in its own right. While an upgraded flux core has been fitted to power the additional weapon mounts, compromises in power allocation result in a notably underpowered shield generator.

Tarsus-class ships are well known as perhaps the most flexible and durable freighters in the Sector. 

The secret to their reliability is that they were intended by Domain designers as hazard duty ships, presumably to supply frontiers and those front line fleets send to quash the ever-present rumbling of insurrection on the far reaches of the Domain.

Almost unmatched among civilian ships in bulkhead structural density and armor rating, Tarsus-class freighters are entrusted with important hauls and usually travel in convoys, a further buttress to the safety they afford to their crew and cargo.

Minimal weapon mounts permit the ship to mount a nominal PD weapons package. Rarely, Tarsus-class ships are outfitted with combat oriented hull or armor boosting modifications, which make them more difficult to maintain.",,,
vayra_lr_mining_drone,SHIP,"The particular model of Mining Pod produced by this LPC has been equipped with a modified high-intensity burst mining laser, a light launcher for marker flares, and a longer-ranged control transmitter - at the cost of some tactical computing overhead lowering the number of concurrently deployable drones.

Sturdy and uncrewed, the Mining Pod can provide a bit of a distraction and a bit of fire support, and not much else.",,,
vayra_heavy_drone_tender,SHIP,"A hulking deep-space mining vessel, the Badger-class heavy drone tender's capacious cargo holds and launch bay have lent it a reputation as an excellent choice for independent companies looking to expand their inventory. Sturdy armor and versatile weapon mounts - for a utility ship, at least - have made it a favorite of captains who roam far from civilized space.",,,
vayra_prospector,SHIP,"Originally designed for long-haul exploratory and prospecting missions, the Prospector is an agile light utility destroyer with capacious holds and fuel tanks. Equipped with an integrated Ionized Plasma Projector and a pair of hardcoded drone nanoforges, this ship is a favorite of independent captains who operate beyond the fringes of civilized space thanks to its ability to hold off light pirate and corporate raider threats without reliance on escorts - though its lack of military-grade subsystems begins to tell in longer engagements.",,,
vayra_pioneer,SHIP,"Affectionally referred to by its captains and crew as a 'brick', the Pioneer is a cruiser-scale salvage and utility vessel with a long pedigree of success in galactic backwaters such as the Persean sector. Tough armor and remarkably versatile main battery hardpoints have seen it frequently pressed into service by planetary defense forces and mercenary flotillas in the tumultuous cycles since the Collapse.",,,
vayra_pathfinder,SHIP,"Relic of a lost age, the Pathfinder was designed for the use of multisector mining, exploration, and resource extraction conglomerates - titans of industry with interests spanning the full extent of Domain space. Now cut off from their former owners in the relative backwater of the Persean sector, these hardened vessels have found particular favor among the prospectors and scavengers who make their living picking through the Domain's leavings out on the fringe... at least those who are successful, or lucky, enough to acquire one.",,,
vayra_bear,SHIP,"More akin to a mobile station than a ship, the Bear-class superheavy mining platform was originally designed for planetary-scale resource extraction. Bristling with auxiliary mining lasers and carrying a small fleet of attendant drones within its cavernous holds, the Bear is capable of processing a comet or large asteroid into its component materials within a matter of minutes. In the chaos of the post-Collapse Persean Sector, these spaceborne behemoths have also seen service as mobile fire support bases and exploration motherships - at least among those outfits and companies that can afford to fuel and maintain one.",,,
vayra_survey_drone,SHIP,"This light survey pod is equipped with a relatively long-range control transmitter and a light marker flare originally intended for flagging mineral deposits. In the tumultuous cycles following the Collapse, many independent mining/exploratory concerns in the sector have taken advantage of the drone frame's high energy output to refit them with rudimentary ion pulse weaponry.",,,
vayra_mining_platform,SHIP,"Bulky and well-armored against impacts from stray space debris, the unmanned Mining Platform proves just as durable in the face of sentient detritus such as pirates.",,,
vayra_hammer_carrier,SHIP,"These unmanned drone pods mount a single Hammer-class blasting charge, originally intended for asteroid and lunar mining. Slow, unshielded and relatively fragile, they have nevertheless seen frequent use as light strike bombers in the cycles following the collapse. ",,,
vayra_wolverine,SHIP,"A robust drone frigate, carrying a heavy mining blaster along with a veritable arsenal of smaller lasers, and mounting a set of burst-operated maneuvering thrusters allowing it to greatly increase its agility when needed. The Wolverine was designed to support the Bear-class heavy platform in - relatively speaking - delicate operations such as ship- and station-breaking, where the massive bulk and nonmaneuverability of its mothership would cause difficulties.",,,
vayra_mining_hound,SHIP,"This hound has been extensively modified for deep-space mining. Changes include replacement of its weapon hardpoints with energy-capable mounts for blasters or plasma cutters, and the installation of a hardwired light mining laser in the portside engine nacelle. The onboard power plant has been overhauled to support these additions, at the cost of some armor and speed.

An old but durable hull class that lacks a shield generator, this frigate is sometimes used to ferry cargo instead of for combat duty. A lucky or gifted officer could make his fortune given the chance to captain one.",,,
vayra_hail,SHIP,"An exceedingly agile vessel, the Hail-class light pinnace is a recent development by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. While the ship is poorly armed, its causality-violating 'Temporal Shell' system enables it to punch well above its weight.",,,
vayra_direwolf,SHIP,"An agile, technologically advanced destroyer with an oversized weapon mount, an efficient shield generator, and an overtaxed power core - in every way, this is a Wolf-class frigate writ large.",,,
vayra_razorback,SHIP,"A fearsome hand-built gunship, cobbled together from almost-functional scraps of many different vessels and plated over with heavy armor for good measure. The Razorback boasts a salvaged destroyer-grade power core and versatile mounting options allowing it to be refit for a variety of combat roles, although its efficacy in any of them is somewhat handicapped by its sluggish engines and lack of a shield emitter.",,,
vayra_henchman,SHIP,"The Henchman-class is an atmosphere-capable heavy destroyer-sized combat dropship, designed to deploy and support more than a company's worth of marines during planetside operations such as tech raids. Compared to the more common Valkyrie, it sacrifices some agility and troop capacity in exchange for heavier armor and radial weapon mounts useful for ground support.

Enterprising fleet commanders have been known to lean into the Henchman's capabilities by outfitting its radial mounts with anti-ship weapons and installing a jury-rigged fighter nanoforge in the shuttle bay, converting the dropship into a light carrier with the ability to protect itself both on-mission and in space combat.",,,
vayra_greyhound,SHIP,"A common modification package among independent and pirate militias thanks to its simplicity, the Greyhound has been refit for combat rather than light shipping. An auxiliary powerplant has been installed in place of the shielded cargo hold, and light weapon mounts fitted to the engine nacelles along with a system to temporarily overclock ballistic autoloaders for additional firepower.

An old but durable hull class that lacks a shield generator, this frigate is sometimes used to ferry cargo instead of for combat duty. A lucky or gifted officer could make his fortune given the chance to captain one.",,,
vayra_typhon,SHIP,"The Typhon-class cruiser bristles with energy weapon emplacements, backed up by a high-powered flux core more than capable of sustaining their fire for extended periods. Lacking the mobility or forward missile-focused loadout of its cousin the Aurora, the Typhon instead relies on its efficient shield, deep flux reserves, and wide turret arcs for protection. 

A transitional vessel produced by the Tri-Tachyon corporation to placate old-guard Domain Navy procurement officers seeking a return to the 'glory' of line-cruisers such as the Eagle and Dominator, the Typhon is a product of the same school of warship design that produced the Paragon-class battleship.",,,
vayra_badger_p,SHIP,"A pirate-built derived class, based on the Badger heavy mining drone tender. The additions include applique armor welded over the front bulkheads, a large central drive unit, and a heavy spinal gun mount. Due to the lack of supporting upgrades to the vessel's flux handling infrastructure, viable outfitting options are - fortunately for freighter pilots across the sector - somewhat limited.

A hulking deep-space mining vessel, the Badger-class heavy drone tender's capacious cargo holds and launch bay have lent it a reputation as an excellent choice for independent companies looking to expand their inventory. Sturdy armor and versatile weapon mounts - for a utility ship, at least - have made it a favorite of captains who roam far from civilized space.",,,
vayra_defense_pod_p,SHIP,"Fragile, short-ranged, and barely armed - ultimately, the only good things that can be said about the pirate-built Defense Pod are that at least it is cheap and uncrewed.",,,
vayra_targeting_pod_p,SHIP,"Mounting aether-ballistic computers and triangulation sensors rather than weaponry, the pirate-built Targeting Pod enhances the effective weapons range of its parent ship considerably for as long as it survives in the battlespace.",,,
vayra_blood_dog,SHIP,"An extremely overbuilt and excessively modified Hound, developed well beyond its initial specifications at the hands of its captain, the notorious Gal Paladin. Along with the obvious improvements to its weapons loadout and flux core, it boasts a transplanted military-grade shield generator and a surprisingly advanced C3 suite.",,,
vayra_warlord,SHIP,"The Warlord began its life as a Conquest-class Battlecruiser, possibly one of those originally brought to the sector by the illustrious XIV Battlegroup which founded the Hegemony. However, over the two-hundred-odd intervening cycles it has been repaired and rebuilt so many thimes that very little of the original hull still remains. Its capabilities differ significantly from its parent class, having been completely refit according to Hegemony standard ""Decisive Battle"" doctrine with an improved shield generator, near-impregnable armored belts, and massive Hammer-class torpedo broadsides fed from capacious internal magazines.",,,
vayra_kingfisher,SHIP,"A quick little shuttle with military-grade engines, an efficient shield, relatively heavy armament for its size, and a non-demanding support profile. The Kingfisher is a favorite vessel of not-quite-legitimate businessmen, tramp freighter captains, and other pilots whose work takes them frequently into - and beyond - the many combat zones and contested areas of the sector.",,,
vayra_spade,SHIP,"The Spade is a light hauler and mining launch that, despite an extremely competitive pricing scheme and generally nondemanding support profile, never managed to achieve the same success and ubiquity of its competitors - namely the Hermes, Kite, Pegasus, and eventually the Mercury. The Spade's sole redeeming feature is that with generous machining tolerances and so little internal volume devoted to crew, fuel, or cargo space, customization of the hull and weapon mounts is surprisingly easy. Often criticized for its weak engines, unshielded and essentially unarmored hull, and barely present hardpoint layout, it nonetheless remains in service in the Persean Sector... Most often in the hands of short-haul asteroid miners, in-system smugglers, and extremely down-on-their-luck scavengers or tramp freighter captains. 

Despite being originally manufactured before even the aging Hound, the Spade has been reclassified as a part of the Midline school of ship design due to the style of its engine pods, actually a semi-recent modernization.",,,
vayra_ruin,SHIP,"A prototype heavy defensive frigate, equipped with a low-power phase teleporter system allowing it to remotely deploy light Stinger-class fragmentation mines. Accusations that the vessel's integrated point defense system exceeds the Domain-era restrictions on sub-Gamma-level AI remain - so far - unproven.",,,
vayra_pinnacle,SHIP,"A heavy combat frigate built to high specifications and outfitted with state-of-the-art technology, the Pinnacle is equally comfortable in a close support or line combat role as it is providing point defense or escort cover for larger craft.",,,
vayra_exemplar,SHIP,"A defensive destroyer, standing in stark opposition to typical Expansion Epoch ship design. Light on point defense but carrying a posse of heavily shielded defensive drones, the Exemplar represents what may have been a shift in Domain naval doctrine near the time of the Collapse.",,,
vayra_seer,SHIP,"The Seer is a prototype dedicated support carrier, an attempt to miniaturize potent Recall Device technology for mass deployment on smaller vessels. Lacking in auxiliary weapon mounts, it is typically outfitted with a long-range beam weapon for fire support and must rely heavily on escorts for protection.",,,
vayra_clairvoyant,SHIP,"Recently designed by the Tri-Tachyon corporation in an attempt to close the ""carrier gap"" existing between their forces and other sector navies in the sub-capital range, the Clairvoyant is something of a technological marvel. Blending hyper-advanced flux handling systems and powerful shields with a pair of military-grade fighter nanoforges, the Clairvoyant's only shortcomings are slightly under-spec engine performance and a lack of weapon mounts if not fit with flux-intensive blaster weapons.",,,
vayra_caliban,SHIP,"The Caliban is an advanced asymmetrical heavy fighter design, carrying decoy flares along with a diverse collection of weapons and effective against most targets. Powerful shields give it good staying power in a fight, especially when deployed alongside other shielded fighters to spread damage and give each other time to vent flux.",,,
vayra_hammer_carrier_p_launcher,WEAPON,"This pirate-designed LPC hack forms the standard Hammer-class blasting charge directly into the carrier drone's frame, offering it rudimentary guidance and additional protection on its way to the target - at the cost of speed and, of course, destroying the carrier drone on impact.

These unmanned drone pods mount a single Hammer-class torpedo, originally intended for asteroid and lunar blasting. Slow, unshielded and relatively fragile, they have nevertheless seen frequent use as light strike bombers in the cycles following the collapse. ",Drone,,
vayra_strikefeed,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Temporarily overcharges the vessel's weapon mounts, causing energy emitters to deal increased damage and ballistic systems to cycle faster while both generate significantly less flux.",Offensive,"Increases energy damage, ballistic rate of fire, and reduces all weapon flux generation while active.",
vayra_prospector_drill,WEAPON,"Bombarding targets with a stream of charged, superheated plasma, this weapon makes short work of comets, asteroids, and unshielded hulls alike.",Close Support,,
vayra_lr_mining_laser,WEAPON,"A modification of the ubiquitous mining laser. This particular configuration is equipped with an extended focusing rod, giving it range equal to that of a modern combat laser.",Point Defense,,
vayra_mining_lance,WEAPON,"A modification of the ubiquitous mining laser. This particular configuration boasts a more powerful arc lamp and dedicated feed capacitors, allowing it to fire short bursts at a much higher intensity.",Point Defense,,
vayra_grav_blaster,WEAPON,"An atypical late-model miniaturized and mass-produced blaster weapon which is highly effective against shields, utilizing techniques discovered during development of the Graviton Beam. Fires pulses of energy which create micro-rifts in the local brane fabric, causing higher-brane gravitons to enter our space-time en masse and inflict violent gravimetric shearing on the target.",Suppression,,
vayra_phase_blaster,WEAPON,"A late-model miniaturized and mass-produced blaster weapon, utilizing techniques discovered during development of the Phase Lance. Fires destructive bolts of energy which exist partially in p-space, giving them excellent velocity at the cost of a shorter time-to-live.",General,,
vayra_light_cutter,WEAPON,"A short-range plasma cutter commonly used in heavy industrial shipbreaking or asteroid mining applications. While capable of projecting a great deal of thermal energy, its extremely limited range and high flux cost mean it is only employed as a weapon by the mad or truly desperate.",Strike,,
vayra_heavy_cutter,WEAPON,"A heavy industrial plasma cutter, slaved to a primitive combat targeting system and reprogrammed for use as a strike weapon. Capable of burning through even capital-grade armor in seconds, though its short range means few captains with access to one would be insane or recklessly suicidal enough to attempt such a feat.",Strike,,
vayra_degraded_taclaser,WEAPON,"Standard combat laser, manufactured from an aging and partially corrupted blueprint. Poor quality lenses lead to significant blooming, reducing effective range and damage - on the other hand, simple and robust circuitry makes for little mounting overhead.",Close Support,,
vayra_degraded_particle_beam,WEAPON,"A comet ice-mining tool repurposed as a weapon, manufactured from an aging or corrupted master blueprint. Poor-quality projector assembly significantly reduces damage potential and effective combat range, though it does have fairly low mounting overhead.",Assault,,
vayra_combat_laser,WEAPON,"High-powered general purpose combat laser, effective at medium to long ranges. Powerful targeting system also tracks small-signature threats such as missiles, though its bulky emitter assembly has some difficulty keeping up with fast-moving targets at close range.",Close Support,,
vayra_biorifle,WEAPON,"Spitting forth an unstable bundle of exotic plasma that rapidly destabilizes and scatters into nearly-as-dangerous 'child' particles, this rare piece of Domain-era industrial equipment was once used for exoplanet-scale excavation and earth removal projects. Now, in the chaos of the post-Collapse Persean Sector, it has been turned towards a new purpose in the hands of enterprising deep-fringe scavengers - warfare.

Recovered tech such as this is as rare in the sector as it is powerful, and the scavengers who risk their lives to bring it back from the far-flung fringe systems where it can be found often prefer to keep it for themselves.",Close Support,,
vayra_particle_beam,WEAPON,"This repurposed Domain-era heavy industrial tool operates by propelling a stream of microscopic fines at near-relativistic speeds, cutting through unprotected hull as easily as it does through comet ice. The continued impacts also transfer a significant amount of force to the target, enough to temporarily overpower the stabilizing thrusters of small craft.

Recovered tech such as this is as rare in the sector as it is powerful, and the scavengers who risk their lives to bring it back from the far-flung fringe systems where it can be found often prefer to keep it for themselves.",Assault,,
vayra_bearclaw,WEAPON,"A massively upsized version of the ubiquitous Mining Blaster, fully integrated into the flux circuits and hull of the Bear for increased efficiency and range. Powerful capacitors allow the device to project a devastating fusillade of energy bolts, shattering warship armor as easily as it does comet ice or planetary crusts - although it does take longer to charge and refire than its smaller cousin.",General,,
vayra_degraded_pulselaser,WEAPON,"A jury-rigged pulse laser, deliberately underclocked in order to account for manufacture from a partially corrupted blueprint. Mounting requirements are significantly reduced and integral microvents much more capable of dissipating weapon flux thanks to reduced power output. Smaller photon packets fired are less prone to aether scattering, increasing their range.",Assault,,
vayra_micropulser,WEAPON,"Standard IR pulse combat laser, deliberately underclocked for maximum flux efficiency at the cost of range and energy throughput. Low power requirements make for dramatically simpler mounting procedures.",Assault,,
vayra_ion_scatterer,WEAPON,"The baryonic chamber of this ion cannon has been modified to project a hail of weaker ion bolts rather than focusing its energy into a single shot, at the cost of some range.",Special,,
vayra_hammer_pod,WEAPON,"A twin-arm launching rack, autoloading Hammer-class torpedoes from an internal magazine. Commonly installed on heavy asteroid-cracking vessels, and infamous for its use by the poor and the desperate as an impromptu strike weapon.",Strike,,
vayra_annihilator_rack,WEAPON,"Fires a stream of unguided rockets that cover a narrrow arc. Typically used to strip away enemy armor once shields are down.

Medium to long-range rockets launched from a small rack that fires ten missiles in a narrow spread to improve the odds of hitting. Rockets are small and unguided, with the extra space being taken up by a larger warhead and improved propulsion systems, as well as thicker armor. 

Performs well against larger targets due to the higher chance of striking with multiple rockets. A rocket attack is often used as a screen before a torpedo strike to reduce the effectiveness of Point Defense systems.",Assault,,
vayra_annihilator_barrage,WEAPON,"Fires a spread of unguided rockets that cover a wide arc. Useful for dealing with large, armored targets at close range, or for blanketing a wide area to catch enemy small craft.

Medium to long-range rockets launched from a large pod that fires twenty missiles per salvo in a wide spread to saturate an area with fire. Rockets are small and unguided, with the extra space being taken up by a larger warhead and improved propulsion systems, as well as thicker armor. 

Performs well against larger targets due to the higher chance of striking with multiple rockets. A rocket attack is often used as a screen before a torpedo strike to reduce the effectiveness of Point Defense systems. Takes several seconds to reload after a salvo.",Assault,,
vayra_looted_tpc,WEAPON,"This Thermal Pulse Cannon has been ripped from its original mounting in the arm of an Onslaught and transplanted to this new vessel, with its muzzle affixed to a frankly underpowered turret mechanism. With so much damage to its internals, the weapon's power throughput, flux efficiency, range, accuracy, and capacitor storage have all suffered greatly.

Someone has hung a small wooden sign over the main access panel which reads, incongruously, 'NOT CANON'.",Assault,,
vayra_harvester_rack,WEAPON,"Harvester-class unguided torpedoes make use of a simple but effective armored casing, greatly improving their survivability and time-to-live in hostile point defense environments. The casing fragments into shrapnel upon detonation, somewhat diminishing direct blast damage to armor but causing devastating spalling when striking bare hull.",Strike,,
vayra_light_particle_beam,WEAPON,"Unlike the larger particle accelerators commonly used for deep-space comet and asteroid mining, the light particle streamer is designed from the ground up for use as a weapon. While it packs significantly less power and range than its larger cousins, a powerful turret motor and targeting array allows it to function as a brutally effective point defense and close-in weapons system - albeit one with a significant refire delay.",Point Defense,,
vayra_thermal_lance_builtin,WEAPON,"A bulky energy weapon from an early epoch, the TPL is built directly into the Subjugator's hull and provides devastating close-range strike potential against undefended armor and hull. Designed after the Thermal Pulse Cannon of the Onslaught-class Battleship but before modular energy weapons became widespread in the Domain military, the TPL boasts several advances over that venerable weapon allowing it to be carried (and powered) by this cruiser-class hull.",Assault,,
vayra_precision_mortar,WEAPON,"A far cry from the Light Mortars seen on civilian craft and pirate raiders, the Precision Mortar was developed only a short period before the Collapse to refit 'obsolete' ballistic-armed warships for close support duty. Baryonic-sheathed antiproton shell cores and advanced recoil compensation give it impressive damage and accuracy, though the integration can be taxing on a vessel's ordnance capacity.",,,
vayra_shortcircuit_driver,WEAPON,"This Hypervelocity Driver has been redesigned from the ground up for short-range combat and electromagnetic secondary effects. The circuit which would normally power the second stage has been redirected, drastically overcharging the magnetic shells for increased electronic disruption at the cost of some accuracy. As a bonus, the reduced complexity of the weapon results in less complex mounting procedures.",,,
vayra_not_guardian,WEAPON,"A collection of high-intensity pulsed mining lasers mounted together on a powerfully motorized turret, with a built-in capacitor allowing extremely rapid operation for short periods of time. Originally designed for precision application, it now finds itself just as effective against strike craft and missile threats as it once was at extracting rare minerals.",Point Defense,,
