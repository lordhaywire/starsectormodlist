The Lion's Guard consists of the most devoted employees, who receive top quality training and equipment to protect Sindrian Fuel assets and ensure the continued competitiveness of Sindrian Antimatter Fuel throughout the sector. Many question why a company like Sindrian Fuel would require such a heavily armed paramilitary unit when most duties are handled by regular security forces, but these questions usually are silenced by reminders of how dangerous the Persean Sector is and a note that the Lion's Guard is solely used for private defense purposes only. Any rumors of Lion's Guard operations to destabilize other markets to make way for a Sindrian Fuel franchise are completely unsubstantiated, and clearly they come from jealous rivals intending to tarnish the company's pristine public image. And for Ludd's sake, don't ask why the Guard's named for a Lion.",
