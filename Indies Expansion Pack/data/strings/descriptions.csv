acs_sumpter,SHIP,"A cute tiny cargo hauler that look more like a flying trasheap that come out straight from deeps of salvage yards.

 Sumpter, its tiny COZY cargo hauler capable of atmospheric landing that seemingly made out a hab-module with engine strapped into it, a spaceborne vessel with very VERY generous logistical requirement with almost equally GENEROUS perfomance and basic life support issue, who its users often call an ""unnecessary"" feature.
 
A vessl so questionable that Hegemony authority have an issue with it basic classification, hovering back and forth between ""Frigates"" or ""Shuttle"", because despite how tiny this vessel are, it somehow capable of having medium size weapon mouth crammed into its hulls, an HYBRID mount nonetheless seemingly intended to hold both mining blaster (as if it can fire it anyway) and ""gun"" to deter invader away (lol).

It also somehow able to hold suprisingly big amount of storage capacity, it even have build-in DRONE AUTOFACTORY (albeit very tiny and few drone), that can be used to help with mining and moving the cargo around, with cozy view for its user to eat ice sundae while waiting for its mining drones finish gathering the mineral.

Its origin is as obscure as its creator, allegedly developed around late pioneering period by group of disgruntled settler who frustrated by the fact they had to lives their ENTIRE lives in same metal box in some god forgotten station, for generation and generation to come, and finally develop this abomination so that they can roam free (lol) from place to place instead being bounded to their accursed birthplace until the end of their lives.

Allegedly those same group of pioneer also happen to be among the first, victim of space piracy in lawless area of the frontier, right the moment they step out from navy zone of patrol. 

This vessel has become staple for small time miner, and diehard nomad and pioneer, who prefer to be moving from place to place instead being constrained in one place, regarding it more of mobile nomadic home than simple flying piece of trash.",,,

acs_palatine,SHIP,"A fearsome multi-role battlecruiser, a byproduct of failed modernization program an end result of Domain attempt at combining Legion and Onslaught into single ship, and prime example of Logisticarum attempt to achieve brutal logistical efficenty and simplicity.

A Palatine, is essentially an attempt by Domain Navy, to further maximize its brutal logistical efficenty to the limit, mostly by combining Legion and Onslaught into a single vessel capable to fulfill both role of main Capital Battleship and Battle Carrier, initially aiming to eventually replace both Onslaught and Legion as main battleship of Domain Navy.

However, by the time its project finish, the doctrinal trend is already shifting to that of ""Middle"" style ship, pushed by proponent of ""Cruiser School"" faction with domain admirality, Palatine which backed by people from ""Old Man"" of armada, naturally end up being rejected, in favor of more ""Modern"" and experimental design like Conquest Battleship, citing its lack of specialization and mobility.

This despite the fact that Palatine is equipped with experimental ""Flux Jump"" system, an ""Old Man"" of armada answer to one of ""Cruiser School"" main critism of old doctrine lack of mobility, An mobility system that allow it vessel to quickly re-positioning itself to go back and forth, allowing it vesself to quickly retreat or positioning itself to back of the line or other strategic position within fleet formation.

As byproduct of failed modernization attempt, Palatine Class Battleship quickly sweep under rugs with advent of ages of ""Cruiser School"" vessel come to forfront, severely limited it production and adoption, only finding its place in few battlegroups that value its brutal logistical efficenty and multi-role capability within their doctrinal stratagem.",,,
acs_palatine_p,SHIP,"A very rare sight among pirates fleet, this seemingly variant of Palatine Battlecruiser has undergo significant modification to the hull, particullary its engine who clearly show sign of ripped off atlas engine, This Legion variant are likely procured either from rare spoil of war or scavenged from one of many derelict Palatine Battlecruiser left by remnant of scuttled or mothballed vessel Domain Navy.

acs_optio,SHIP,"Optio in essence, is a more of defensive upgrade and variant of Centurion Heavy Frigates, A part of yet another failed project aim to modernize the aging and outdated Domain Navy fleets.

Originally intended to better serve as Defensive Escort Frigate for fleets of Onslaughts and Legion, a mobile enough frigates to withstand and hold the line from swarms of flanking frigates, and thick enough frigates to able to hold its own ground against enemy destroyer.

All those defensive upgrades turns this already robust frigates into ""Ideal"" Defense Escort Frigates, this however came at cost of severely limited but more manuverable engine, and removal of original Damper Field system to make room for stronger shield generator, it also removes 2 of its side small ballistic mount in favor of heavier armor and thicker hulls, in exchange of all that is additional medium hybrid frontal hardpoint, and small defensive drone bay, to assist them in defending and supporting allied vessels.

With advent of ""Cruiser Schools"" doctrine, this vessels end up largely abandoned in favor of its more faster and versatile predecessor, lacking use of dedicated armored escort frigate that barely able to keep up with more ""Midline"" esque capital that its escort, only find it use in battlegroup that still haven't adopt new official doctrine.",,,

Voidfaring ships, as the name implies, is a type of ship that designed to cross the abyss of space without the help of gates system. likely derived from ship of the era where convenient long range transportation device such as gates havent invented. Djoeng Class Voidfaring Hubship is designed to be a traveling colony or pioneering vessels first and foremost, carrying with them the entire colony and its people to set out to the unknown to find their new home, or simply living their entire lives as travelling colony fleet, never stay too long in one place and always moving alone.

While this class of ship was never meant to go alone without numerous escort and companion fleet following them. It nonetheless equipped with suficient amount of armament and armor, a station grade advance targeting system, indepedent shield module, and whole dedicated gantry to host, maintain, and create smaller vessel, providing huge logistic support to entire fleets with its existence alone.

It is said that after the company who made Tarsus and Barnabas manages to acquire license to produce and modify Atlas-Class Superfreighter, their engineer quickly design new Capital class Combat Freighter designed to withstand all kind of threat that it will face in active warzone, fullfilling the demand for tough and dependable large freighter that can safely transport vital material and resource needed in middle of the warzone.",,,
