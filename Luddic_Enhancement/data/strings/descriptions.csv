hermes_pather,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

The Hermes is a small, dependable cargo hauler often converted for transport duty among poor frontier worlds. Its crew and passenger facilities are charitably described as ""robust"" but it manages to get the job done with remarkable consistency despite the primitive maintenance facilities it frequents.

Factory-spec, the Hermes is armed only for ""active collision avoidance"", but its turret system is often upgraded to achieve nearly full albeit light point-defense coverage that can destroy the stray missile while escaping from active combat zones. This Luddic Pather modification, however, strips out most of the cargo and crew space and small weapon mounts in favour of a medium hound-scavanged ballistic hardpoint, along with overcharged engines to quickly leap in, strike, and leap out again. While usually manned by the desperate or the mad, some truly legendary Martyrs started their lives as a Hermes captain.",,,
mule_lp_x,SHIP,"This ramshackle vessel is assembled from a Nebula and a Mule by Pathers. With the cargo compartments removed and replaced with weaponry, hull reinforcement, and overtuned engines, this ship is incredibly fast and packs a mighty punch. However it is noticeably fragile, unsurprising given its uneven construction. This however does not deter the most Faithful of the Path who desire a Martyrs death, something this ship is almost guaranteed to give.",,,
venture_luddic_path,SHIP,"A Venture that has been altered by Luddic fanatics, this ship has had the cargo bay replaced with a large ballistic mount and additionally smaller mounts. This additon of ordinance has compromised the internal structure of the vessel, which is further strained by the overdriven engines and enhanced flux systems, however despite these changes this vessel is surprisingly sturdy.

Tough, dependable and not overly expensive, Venture-class cruisers are usually constructed by private corporations for escort duty or by small non-aligned worlds for system defense.

The Venture-class ships are perhaps the most widely used civilian cruisers in the Sector. The blueprints for the Venture are widely available and can often be secured without too much trouble. 

When used by small corporations, the ship is usually the pride of the fleet and is used to underpin vital operations. Due to its ubiquity, the vessel also serves with quite a few pirate outfits, where it sometimes fills the role of command ship.",,,
phaeton_lp,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

Typically a medium tanker is left a smoking ruin in the wake of the Luddic Path. Sometimes, however, the hulls are stolen away, and completely remade. Now it forms sa flexible, if fragile destroyer, able to attack at range with its missile armament, or demolish foes up close with its large ballistic.",,,
starliner_lp,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

Originally a symbol of Man's folly in conquering the universe with forbidden technology, this ship has been completely remade into a ramshackle support vessel. Wide crew decks and promenades have been stripped out and replaced with weapons, fighter autofactories and marine boarding facilities. With an incredibly strong missile complement and a flight deck, this ship has an ample range of tactical flexibility - however it's lackluster hull integrity is an issue.",,,
starliner_lp_x,SHIP,"A Starliner modified by the Luddic Path, this vessel replaces the decadent crew compartments with hull reinforcement, weapons, engines and superior flux infrastructure to fight the followers of Moloch. Surprisingly nimble for its size and packed with weaponry, the craft is also fragile in the face of withering fire. A feared vessel, this overtuned cruiser can crush any diabolical vessel smaller than it, but tends to turn its crew into Martyrs when encountering larger enemies.",,,
eagle_le_lp,SHIP,"Almost unrecognisable from the original Eagle, this practically scrapped cruiser has had large portions of the structure removed and replaced with ballistic mounts. While the ship has been drastically down-armoured, the vent management system has been maintained  (albeit poorly), and additional engines have been crudely added. An incredibly dangerous weapon of Holy War (both to its crew and its enemies), this Luddic vessel is blisteringly quick and startlingly resilient.

Eagle-class cruisers are often found at the core of military fleets headed for battle. It is not hard to see why: A strong overall profile, with a robust engine, the Eagle's deadly weapons package is a threat to all enemies.

The Eagle can deliver a strong tactical punch to enemy formations. Its numerous turret and hardpoint emplacements make it very dangerous to smaller foes. Decent armor and a strong shield emitter let it hold space while outnumbered, or even when faced with the rare larger ship. 

These strengths are somewhat countered by strike craft - an Eagle captain must always watch their scopes for an approaching strike squadron, since their ship will be easily crippled by multiple hits from modern strike weapons. 

The embodiment of the sleek and powerful space cruiser from the time of the Domain, the Eagle-class ships are a beautiful reminder of the technological and aesthetic achievements of humanity's past. ",,,
le_prometheus3,SHIP,"The fanatical Pathers have discovered an ironic sense of justice in converting the tanker which carries what they call 'Infernium' - AM fuel - into a hulking implement of holy war. Unlike the Prometheus Mk II. occassionally seen in Luddic Path fleets, this derivative still has most of its pre-existing civilian infrastructure intact. Instead, a makeshift ship factory has been installed in the now cored-out main fuel tank. It is from this drydock that a ramshackle suicide ship laden with explosives can be flown out of to bring the Divine Retribution of the Light of Ludd to the servants of Moloch, granting salvation in complete annhiliation.",,,
lp_dram_missile,SHIP,"A stripped-back Dram hull filled with explosives, this improvised suicide vessel can cripple stations and fleet vessels if it can make contact. However, its ramshackle construction lacks structural stability and the vessel can be disabled by withering firepower.",,,
dram_lp_ied,SHIP,"An improvised explosive Dram, this stripped-back hull is filled with explosives and crewed by Martyrs, who are willing to sell their lives dearly for Ludd.

This oversized improvised explosive device a simple Dram loaded with fuel and precisely placed explosives, which on activation gradual begins to leak Infernium into surrounding space, before the explosives trigger and ignite the fuel. The resulting explosion is devastating against anything in range. Luckily, the crude nature of the ship prevents the explosion from being very large, and the ship itself is incredibly fragile, meaning it can be avoided either by keeping distance or shooting the vessel before it comes too close.",,,
phaeton_lp_ied,SHIP,"An improvised explosive Phaeton, this stripped-back hull is filled with explosives and crewed by Martyrs, who are willing to sell their lives dearly for Ludd.

This oversized improvised explosive device a simple Phaeton loaded with fuel and precisely placed explosives, which on activation gradual begins to leak Infernium into surrounding space, before the explosives trigger and ignite the fuel. The resulting explosion is devastating against anything in range. Luckily, the ship itself is incredibly fragile, meaning it can be avoided either by keeping distance or shooting the vessel before it comes too close. Unluckily, this vessel is able to pack more fuel and more explosive, greatly enhancing its destructive reach.",,,
prometheus_lp_ied,SHIP,"An improvised explosive Prometheus, this stripped-back hull is filled with explosives and crewed by Martyrs, who are willing to sell their lives dearly for Ludd.

This oversized improvised explosive device a simple Prometheus loaded with fuel and precisely placed explosives, which on activation gradual begins to leak Infernium into surrounding space, before the explosives trigger and ignite the fuel. The resulting explosion is devastating against anything in range. Luckily, the ship itself is incredibly fragile, meaning it can be avoided either by keeping distance or shooting the vessel before it comes too close - something that should be easy to accomplish considering the slow speed of the craft. Unluckily, this vessel is able to pack a frightening amount of missile armament, greatly enhancing its destructive reach.",,,

fidem,SHIP,"A heavy frigate, this vessel can fulfil a number of roles due to its flexible armament, fighter deck bay and ammunition feeder system. However, its logistical profile is often found to be too high for its class, especially when compared with more specialised hulls.

While the Mora was a ubiquitous hull during the Expansion Era of the Domain of Man, the smaller Fidem saw significantly less interest. Based on similar principles, the Fidem was designed to be a rugged, hardy frigate that could fulfill a variety of roles. And for its size, it was able to achieve a vast array of functions, with a combination of flight deck, Accelerated Ammunition Feeder system and flexible missile mounts in a small, heavily armoured package. However, the hull was simply too expensive to maintain when compared with its smaller, cheaper and more specialised competition - the Shepherd. Consequently the vessel fell out of use for centuries until the Church of Galactic Redemption picked up the safely archaic design to lend fighter coverages to smaller patrols.",,,
lector,SHIP,"The Lector is positively archaeological design, still utilising an old Damper Field as its defensive system. With an oversized armament, good speed and decent armour, this vessel shows its age in extended engagements due to its lack of shield generator.

The Lector was a very early chassis designed to provide fire support for flanking maneuvers. With a rather modest (for the time) armament and a system to temporarily boost the reload speed of the ballistics weaponry, this ship could very rapidly capitalise on the vulnerable sides and rear of the enemy battle line. It also saw extensive usage in patrols, as its speed enabled it to catch up to light craft and crush them.

However, the Lector had been designed with the idea that a shield generator could never be produced small enough and efficient enough to be utilised by craft smaller than an orbital station. When such a generator was eventually produced, and installation of it into the Lector was deemed impractical, the craft rapidly fell out of use outside of pirate bands and fringe outposts, and then into memory. The Lector, since being rediscovered, has been picked up by the Church of Galactic Redemption as a fast attack destroyer due to the simplistic technology used in its creation and maintenance, and for its disproportionate speed and armament.",,,
fasces,SHIP,"Packing a powerful punch and solid armour, the Fasces is a destroyer with ample armament and a large missile slot. While these features appear attractive on paper, many are often turned away by its disproportionately high logistical cost.

The Fasces is an old vessel, designed to provide close missile support in front-line combat. The result was an awkward ship that was too large to be a destroyer, yet it's armament was too undersized for a cruiser. The craft itself was also disproportionally expensive to maintain, and combined with limited maneuverability the ship faded out of widespread usage when tactics began to switch towards the more mobilty-focused Expansion doctrine. The Church of Galactic Redemption has since picked up the technologically inferior design as a solid if expensive artillery vessel.",,,
christopher,SHIP,"A paradoxical heavy light cruiser, the Christopher is a defensive escort vessel. Limited in mobilty and with its strong ballistic armament unable to adequeately focus, the Christopher is nevertheless an effective choice for dealing with small targets in battle-line settings, protecting larger craft from flanking frigates and fighters.

The Christopher is an incredibly awkward design by modern conventions. Its size, armament and logistical profile puts it in the light cruiser range, yet it's armour and flux capactiance places it in the heavy cruiser category. In its day it was designed to stand on the battle line to shield other ships and destroy missile and fighter formations. However, in this dual role as armoured anvil and escort gunboat it has long since been supplanted by the Dominator and the Enforcer, respectively. This archaic design, however, has been adopted by the Church of Galactiv Redemption due to its old fashioned technological infrastructure to beef up its battlefleets.",,,
sebastian,SHIP,"A venerable design, the Sebastian is an oversized cruiser carrier with focused forward-facing ballistic firepower. When combined with its fighter wings this ship can concentrate a lot of ordinance on a single foe, however the vessel is let down by poor mobilty and a strenuous logistics profile.

The Sebatian was born of the original Expansion Era battle line doctrine, with a strong focus on ballistic firepower and heavy armour. The vessel was intended to not only provide fighter support, but also stand on its own against the fire of enemy ships. In these key features the Sebastian was outstanding. However, it soon fell victim to its design parameters - it was designed to fly at the same speed as the slower main line vessels, but as doctrines evolved to a more mobility based doctrine, the Sebastian proved simply too slow and too expensive when compared with the newer models, sucha s the Heron. Its slow speed and high logistical profile rapidly buried the Sebastian as a combat ship as fleet ships became more mobile, but has been picked up by the Church of Galactic Redemption due to the lack of excessively advanced technology. The ship is now an effective  fleet anchor, able to strike at range with fighters while keeping enemies at bay with its firepower.",,,

#Light of Ludd,,,,,
le_dram_w,WEAPON,"The strongest weapon in the Sacred Arsenal against the agents of Moloch, the Divine Light of Ludd is a stripped-back Dram hull loaded with explosives. The lightness and fragility of the improvised ship, combined with the fact that it's loaded with bombs and fuel, means the ship is somewhat fragile. However, the ship-sized missile is fast, and if it makes it within range of its target it can bring annhilitic salvation to stations and capital ships, and even remove cruisers from the void.",,,

#Alexandretta,,,,,
hegemony_hera,CUSTOM,"A remnant of the Alexandretta Polity, this base was forciably acquired by the Hegemony during the invasion of the Pirate Lord Scarborough in the name of 'protecting the citizens of Alexandretta'. Although the Hegemony leadership has made several promises to vacate the facility and return it to the Alexandretta Polity in the wake of Scarborough's defeat on Cerberus, the station still remains in Hegemony hands, and increasingly it appears that this fact will not change in the future. Understandably, ownership of this station is a sore topic for most Alexandrettans.",,,
luddicchurch_cerebrus,CUSTOM,"The seat of the Alexandretta Polity, this planet was the site of the last battle against the Pirate Lord Scarborough many cycles ago. While the surface of Cerberus was nearly destroyed in the attack, the Alexandrettans were able to fight off the invading pirates. However, the cost of the attack was horrific. Encroaching Hegemony influence in the wake of the assault and the weakness of the now crippled Polity drove the Alexandrettans to turn to the Luddic Church for assistance. The planet is now a somewhat loyal bastion to the Luddic Church, if more out of necessity rather than genuine faith. The remnants of Cerberus' industry now fuels a limited ship building program sanctioned by the Church, further increasing the theological dubiousness of the planet.",,,
planet_artaxerxes,CUSTOM,"When Lord Scarborough initially invaded Alexandretta, the lush alpine planet of Artaxerxes was the first to face his terrible hunger. The meagre first-responding defence force was completely annhiliated, with the fractured remnants driven back to Cerberus, and leaving the populace to the deprivations and horrors of Lord Scarborough. Luckily, the defiance of the populace was able to keep the pirate forces occupied even after grievous retributions by the pirates, enabling stronger defences to muster at Cerberus. Unfortunately the Alexandretta Polity could not liberate the beleaguered populace, hard-pressed as they were to defend themselves. They were forced to watch as Artaxerxes and its populace were burnt in retribution for its defiance, in what is arguably the first usage of starship fuel to achieve complete planetary destruction.",,,
